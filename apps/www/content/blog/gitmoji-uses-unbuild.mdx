In this article, we review how Gitmoji uses unbuild to bundle its package. The following concepts are discussed:

* What is Gitmoji?
    
* How I came across Gitmoji?
    
* What is unbuild?
    
* unbuild configuration in Gitmoji package
    

### What is Gitmoji?

Gitmoji is an emoji guide for GitHub commit messages. Aims to be a standarization cheatsheet - guide for using emojis on GitHub’s commit messages.

Using emojis on commit messages provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of a commit with only looking at the emojis used.

Read more about [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/about).

### How I came across Gitmoji?

I read open-source code a lot and share the insights via this articles. I saw emojis in [Lobechat commit history](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat).

It got me thinking why is there an emoji in a commit message? for example, the following are commit messages copied from [Lobechat](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat).

```js
🐛 fix: remove orphan chunks if there is no related file
✨ feat: support TTS & STT
📝 docs: update docs
```

And then I recalled a [mention of Gitmoji in the Lobechat contribution](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/0533150f586e0c0c00b61dcb2f1cc4df9860993f/contributing/Basic/Intro.md?plain=1#L89)

### What is unbuild?

[unbuild](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild) is a unified JavaScript build system. Features include

* [Optimized bundler](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild?tab=readme-ov-file#-optimized-bundler)
    
* [Automated config](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild?tab=readme-ov-file#-automated-config)
    
* [Bundleless build](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild?tab=readme-ov-file#-automated-config)
    
* [Passive watcher](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild?tab=readme-ov-file#-passive-watcher)
    
* [Untype Generator](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild?tab=readme-ov-file#-untype-generator)
    
* [Secure builds](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-secure-builds)

#### Usage

Unbuild usage is quite straightforward. You create your files inside src/index.ts. The below code is picked from [docs](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild?tab=readme-ov-file#usage).

```js
// inside src/index.ts
export const log = (…args) => {
 console.log(…args);
};
```

Next step is to update package.json as shown below:

```js
{
 "type": "module",
 "scripts": {
 "build": "unbuild",
 "prepack": "unbuild"
 },
 "exports": {
 ".": {
 "import": "./dist/index.mjs",
 "require": "./dist/index.cjs"
 }
 },
 "main": "./dist/index.cjs",
 "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
 "files": ["dist"]
}
```

You can configure unbuild to meet your needs. Read more about [configuration](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).

### unbuild configuration in Gitmoji package

Based on the usage described above, Gitmoji has the same unbuild setup, the below is the [Gitmoji package.json](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji/blob/master/packages/gitmojis/package.json)

```js
{
  "name": "gitmojis",
  "type": "module",
  "version": "3.14.0",
  "description": "An emoji guide for your commit messages.",
  "main": "./dist/index.cjs",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/index.mjs",
      "require": "./dist/index.cjs"
    }
  },
  "files": [
    "dist"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon --exec 'pnpm run build' --watch ./src",
    "build": "unbuild",
    "lint:json": "ajv --spec=draft2020 validate -s ./src/schema.json -d ./src/gitmojis.json",
    "lint": "pnpm run lint:json && prettier --check ./src/**/*.{js,json,ts}",
    "publishPackage": "npm publish"
  },
...
```

There is no build.config.ts found in [Gitmoji package](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji/tree/master/packages/gitmojis).

To build this package, you just have to run `npm run build`.
