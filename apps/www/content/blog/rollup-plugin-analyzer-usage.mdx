title: rollup-plugin-analyzer usage in trpc scripts
---

In the previous article, we provided a mental picture of functions in [analyzeSizeChange.ts file](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/next/scripts/analyzeSizeChange.ts), In this article, let’s find out how the actual size change is analyzed.

```plaintext
import analyze from 'rollup-plugin-analyzer';
export default function analyzeSizeChange(packageDir: string) {
 let analyzePluginIterations = 0;
 return analyze({
   summaryOnly: process.env.CI ? undefined : true,
   skipFormatted: process.env.CI ? true : undefined,
   onAnalysis: (analysis) => {
   },
 });
}
```

`analyze` is imported from `rollup-plugin-analyzer`. It’s got an object as param with [options](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-analyzer#options):

1. summaryOnly — Only output bundle summary and module usage bar graphs
    
2. skipFormatted — Don’t output formatted string
    
3. onAnalysis — Callback to be invoked with analysis object (I copied the below description for onAnalysis from npm:)
    

function will be invoked with:  
\- analysisObject (Object)  
\- bundleSize (Number) — rendered bundle size in bytes  
\- bundleOrigSize (Number) — original bundle size in bytes  
\- bundleReduction (Number) — percentage of rendered bundle size reduction  
\- moduleCount (Number) — Count of all included modules  
\- modules (Array) — array of module analysis objects  
\- module (Object)  
\- id (String) — path of module / rollup module id  
\- size (Number) — size of rendered module code in bytes  
\- origSize (Number) — size of module’s original code in bytes  
\- dependents (Array) — list of dependent module ids / paths  
\- percent (Number) — percentage of module size relative to entire bundle  
\- reduction (Number) — percentage of rendered size reduction  
\- renderedExports (Array) — list of used named exports  
\- removedExports (Array) — list of unused named exports

Let’s see how many of these options are actually used in [analyzeSizeChange file.](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/next/scripts/analyzeSizeChange.ts)  
\- [bundleSize](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/next/scripts/analyzeSizeChange.ts#L36)  
\- [modules](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/next/scripts/analyzeSizeChange.ts#L38)

Just these are found to be used in analyzeSizeChange.ts

But in what circumstances is this script executed? is it after you check in some code? does it report on a pull request? To find that out, we need to go where the code takes us.

You would have to first search for `analyzeSizeChange` to see where it is used. It is found to be used in [script/getRollupConfig.ts](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/3388c9691d122b9d4047b2de0caedcdf611354ab/scripts/getRollupConfig.ts#L9)

Next, you would have to find out where getRollupConfig is used. It is used in a lot of [packages](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Atrpc%2Ftrpc+getRollupConfig&type=code).

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*zM814-Ubj1vNcOgzudevBw.png)

but I picked [packages/client/rollup.config.ts](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/3388c9691d122b9d4047b2de0caedcdf611354ab/packages/client/rollup.config.ts#L3), this rollup config is used in the build script.

```plaintext
"scripts": {
 "build": "rollup - config rollup.config.ts - configPlugin rollup-plugin-swc3",
```

So the answer, you will have the bundle size changes when you build a package in tRPC source code.
