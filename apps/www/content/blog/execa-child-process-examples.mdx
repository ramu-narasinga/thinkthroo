title: Execa vs using child_process to execute CLI commands programmatically.

In this article, we analyse two ways to execute CLI commands programmatically found in Shadcn/ui and CodeMirror.

Have you ever wondered if it is possible to run CLI commands programmatically? We are going to look at how Shadcn/ui uses execa and how CodeMirror uses child\_process to execute CLI programmaticaly.

### child\_process usage in CodeMirror

CodeMirror is found to be using a Node.js API called `child_process.execFileSync`. [Read more](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_processexecfilesyncfile-args-options)

```plaintext
function run(cmd, args, wd = root, { shell = false } = {}) {
  return child.execFileSync(cmd, args, {shell, cwd: wd, encoding: "utf8", stdio: ["ignore", "pipe", process.stderr]})
}
```

Just to provide a bit more context, this run gets called inside a function called install in CodeMirror source code.

Check the [CodeMirror v6 Readme](https://github.com/codemirror/dev?tab=readme-ov-file#codemirror) to understand what this install is for.

One of the first steps to set up the development environment for CodeMirror is to execute the below command, this is mentioned in [CodeMirror’s Readme.md](https://github.com/codemirror/dev?tab=readme-ov-file#codemirror).

```plaintext
node bin/cm.js install
```

install is parsed using process.argv

### Execa usage in Shadcn/ui

Execa runs commands in your script, application or library. Unlike shells, it is [optimized](https://github.com/sindresorhus/execa/blob/HEAD/docs/bash.md) for programmatic usage. Built on top of the [`child_process`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html) core module.

Shadcn/ui’s add command is found to be execa to install packages
