## **Limited Access Beta**

At the time of writing this article, Dosu is in Beta. If you’re interesting in trying out Dosu, join their waiting list at [https://dosu.dev](https://dosu.dev/) or reach out to dosu team at hi@dosu.dev

Dosu can be installed on any repository, but it will not do anything until you’re taken off the waitlist.
