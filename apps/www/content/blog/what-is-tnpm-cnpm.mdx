I have written an articles explaining [how to install npm packages programmatically](https://medium.com/@thinkthroo/part-1-how-to-install-npm-packages-programmatically-b35f1a2c0142). There’s a function called [getNpmClient](https://github.com/umijs/umi/blob/master/packages/utils/src/npmClient.ts#L13).

# **Detect tnpm/cnpm client**

This comment below and the code show us how you could detect tnpm/cnpm client.

```javascript
// detect tnpm/cnpm client
  // all situations:
  //   - npminstall mode + native fs => generate _resolved field in package.json
  //   - npminstall mode + rapid fs => generate .package-lock.json in node_modules
  //   - npm mode + native fs => generate .package-lock.json in node_modules
  //   - npm mode + rapid fs => generate .package-lock.json in node_modules
  // all conditions:
  //   - has _resolved field or .package-lock.json means tnpm/cnpm
  //   - _resolved field or .package-lock.json contains tnpm registry means tnpm
  if (chokidarPkg._resolved) {
    return tnpmRegistries.some((r) => chokidarPkg._resolved.includes(r))
      ? 'tnpm'
      : 'cnpm';
  } else if (existsSync(tcnpmLockPath)) {
    const tcnpmLock = readFileSync(tcnpmLockPath, 'utf-8');

    return tnpmRegistries.some((r) => tcnpmLock.includes(r)) ? 'tnpm' : 'cnpm';
  }
```

## **Detect tnpm client**

> *has \_resolved field or .package-loc.json means tnpm/cnpm*

This comment explains what this below if block is about

```javascript
if (chokidarPkg._resolved) {
    return tnpmRegistries.some((r) => chokidarPkg._resolved.includes(r))
      ? 'tnpm'
      : 'cnpm';
}
```

## **Detect tnpm client**

> *\- \_resolved field or .package-lock.json contains tnpm registry means tnpm*

This comment above explains the else if block below

```javascript
else if (existsSync(tcnpmLockPath)) {
  const tcnpmLock = readFileSync(tcnpmLockPath, 'utf-8');
```

```javascript
  return tnpmRegistries.some((r) => tcnpmLock.includes(r)) ? 'tnpm' : 'cnpm';
}
```

This is the first time I am learning about tnpm or cnpm. I will write an article about these.

But what is tnpm or cnpm client?

# **tnpm Client**

tnpm is an enterprise service for Alibaba and Ant Group, which is also based on cnpm, with additional enterprise-level customization.

# **cnpm Client**

[cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm) is an open-source implementation of npm, which supports mirror synchronization with the official npm registry and private package capabilities.

There is an [in-depth of tnpm rapid mode — how tnpm managed to be 10 second faster than pnpm](https://dev.to/atian25/in-depth-of-tnpm-rapid-mode-how-could-we-fast-10s-than-pnpm-3bpp)

This article talks in depth about

1. Why is npm soooo slow?
    
2. What are tnpm and cnpm?
    
3. Optimization results and much more.
