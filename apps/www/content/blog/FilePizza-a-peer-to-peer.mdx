# **What is FilePizza?**

*Cooked up by* [*Alex Kern*](https://kern.io/) *&* [*Neeraj Baid*](https://github.com/neerajbaid) *while eating Sliver @ UC Berkeley.*

Using [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/), FilePizza eliminates the initial upload step required by other web-based file sharing services. Because data is never stored in an intermediary server, the transfer is fast, private, and secure.

A hosted instance of FilePizza is available at [file.pizza](https://file.pizza/).

# **How to use FilePizza?**

1. Upload your file
    

Visit [https://file.pizza/](https://file.pizza/) and upload your file that you want to share with your friend/colleague.

2\. Optionally set password, if you wish to, and then click start.

3\. Share the URL with your friend/colleague.

Note: Your files are sent directly from your browser to the downloader’s browser. They never pass through FilePizza servers. FilePizza uses WebRTC to send files. This requires that the uploader leave their browser window open until the transfer is complete.

4\. Download the file from any browser via the URL from the above

Since FilePizza uses WebRTC, you will have to keep the window open in which you have uploaded your file for the dowloads to work.
