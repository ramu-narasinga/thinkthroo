[Components Structure inspired by shadcn-ui/ui]:
[L: Introduction]

In this course, we apply the [shadcn-ui/ui architectural concept, components structure](link-to-guide) to the project
you built in this [setup course](link-to-course).

As you progress through this course, you will make some decisions on how to structure your components and at the same time,
consider the tradeoffs. 

For example: 
- Breaking down a large file into smaller components and placing them in a common `components` folder at root/src level
  would be fine for now as you are only dealing with Contacts page.
- But should you refactor your components structure as your application grows? the answer is yes. 
- What principles should you follow? Find out at the end of this course.

Pre-requisites:
- You must have a basic understanding of Next.js
- You must have completed this [set up course](link-to-course) as that code is used to refactor and upgrade the components
structure.

You are expected to solve these below challenges in this course by refactoring the large Contacts file into smaller
components and organizing these components in folders following the components structure that closel:

Refactor the large Contacts file into smaller components and organize/structure these components in a folder, following
the [shadcn-ui/ui architectural concept, components structure](link-to-guide)

[L: Refactor Sidebar ]
# Challenge
In this challenge, you are expected to refactor the sidebar in the Contacts page 
by moving the sidebar related code into a separate file and folder.

How to solve this challenge?
1. You can place this sidebar in any file/folder you want and name it as you wish, but to 
practice the shadcn-ui/ui architecture, try to match your folder organization to that of shadcn-ui/ui's.
2. Navigate to [shadcn-ui/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) and figure out the how the site header and site footer are implemented. 
3. Follow the same file organization and naming convention patterns as site header/side footer to refactor this sidebar. 

Hint 1:
You can find that [site-header](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/bd54184e6016261148cd4e806fe17c9043678a88/apps/www/components/site-footer.tsx#L1)
 and [site-footer](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/bd54184e6016261148cd4e806fe17c9043678a88/apps/www/components)
located inside `www/components` folder.

Hint 2:
You should create a folder named components at root level.

Hint 3:
You should create a file named site-sidebar and put the sidebar code in it. 

# Solution

[Insert video explanation]

Let's refactor the sidebar related by placing that code in a separate component.

## 1. Create components folder at the root
Create a folder named `components` at the root of your project.

## 2. Create a file named site-sidebar.tsx
Create a file named site-sidebar.tsx inside `components` folder and paste the code from the [Contacts page](link-to-shadcn-base).

Insert the code snippet and show a screenshot of it.

## 3. Import `SiteSidebar` in Contacts page:

Since you now have `SiteSidebar` created, you want to import this component at the top of Contacts page and replace it with the
existing sidebar

Your contacts page should now look like it is in this [commit](link-to-commit)

[L: Refactor Header ]
# Challenge
In this challenge, you are expected to refactor the header in the Contacts page 
by moving the header related code into a separate file and folder.

How to solve this challenge?
1. You can place this header in any file/folder you want and name it as you wish, but to 
practice the shadcn-ui/ui architecture, try to match your folder organization to that of shadcn-ui/ui's.
2. Navigate to [shadcn-ui/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) and figure out the how the site header and site footer are implemented. 
3. Follow the same file organization and naming convention patterns as site header/side footer to refactor this header. 

Hint 1:
You can find that [site-header](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/bd54184e6016261148cd4e806fe17c9043678a88/apps/www/components/site-footer.tsx#L1)
 and [site-footer](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/bd54184e6016261148cd4e806fe17c9043678a88/apps/www/components)
located inside `www/components` folder.

Hint 2:
You should have already created a components folder from [Refactor Sidebar](link-to-sidebar).
If not, You should create a folder named components at root level.

Hint 3:
You should create a file named site-header.tsx and put the header code in it. 

# Solution

[Insert video explanation]

Let's refactor the header by placing that code in a separate component.

## 1. components folder at the root
You should have already created a `components` folder from [Refactor Sidebar](link-to-lesson).
If not, Create a folder named `components` at the root of your project.

## 2. Create a file named site-header.tsx
Create a file named site-header.tsx inside `components` folder and paste the code from the [Contacts page](link-to-shadcn-base).

Insert the code snippet and show a screenshot of it.


## 3. Import `SiteHeader` in Contacts page:

Since you now have `SiteHeader` created, you want to import this component at the top of Contacts page and replace it with the
existing header 

Your contacts page code should now look like it is in this [commit](link-to-commit).

[C: Contacts Page]
[L: Refactor ContactHeader]

# Challenge
So far, we have refactored sidebar component at site level and commonly reused across our CRM application.
Let's now focus on refactoring Contacts Header.

[Insert screenshot of contacts header]

How to solve this challenge?

1. You can place this contacts page header in any file/folder you want and name it as you wish, but to 
practice the shadcn-ui/ui architecture, try to match your folder organization to that of [shadcn-ui/ui's mail example](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/(app)/examples/mail).
2. Navigate to [shadcn-ui/ui's mail example](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/(app)/examples/mail) and figure out the how the mails example is implemented. 
3. You can also read our [architectural guide about mails components structure](link-to-architectural-guide)
4. Follow the same file organization and naming convention patterns as shadcn-ui/ui's mail example to refactor this contacts header. 

Hint 1:
You can find that [mail example](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/(app)/examples/mail) 
colocates the components it uses with in the mail folder
[Insert screenshots of components]

Hint 2:
You could create components folder inside Contacts folder at pages.tsx level 
and colocate the components in this folder that are used in Contacts page

# Solution
Let's colocate the Contacts Header components just like [Shadcn-ui/ui's Mail example](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/(app)/examples/mail)

Step 1: Create components folder inside contacts route.

Step 2: Create a file named header.tsx

> You could name it contacts-header, but keep in mind, we are already inside contacts/components. It just seemed redundant to have contacts
at this point in the file name.

Step 3: Paste the code inside header.tsx

```
Paste the code from contacts/page.tsx into header.tsx
```

Step 4: Import header in contacts page

Import the header component we just created in the above steps and put it in the location where there was header related code before.

[L: Refactor Contacts Table]

# Challenge:
So far, we have refactored sidebar, header, contacts header components in our CRM application.
Let's now focus on refactoring Contacts Table.

[Insert screenshot of contacts table]

The way this contacts table is written is that it's part of Card and is dependent on Tabs value.

[Insert code snippet of Card here]

Our focus at the moment is only on refactoring Contacts table by moving it into a separate file.

How to solve this challenge?

1. You can place this contacts table in any file/folder you want and name it as you wish, but to 
practice the shadcn-ui/ui architecture, try to match your folder organization to that of [shadcn-ui/ui's mail example](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/(app)/examples/mail).
2. Navigate to [shadcn-ui/ui's mail example](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/(app)/examples/mail) and figure out the how the mails example is implemented. 
3. You can also read our [architectural guide about mails components structure](link-to-architectural-guide)
4. Follow the same file organization and naming convention patterns as shadcn-ui/ui's mail example to refactor this contacts header. 
5. You can also follow the same convention used in refactoring contacts header.

Hint 1:
You can follow the same convention used to refactor contacts header.

Hint 2:
Create a file named table.tsx inside contacts/components

# Solution
Let's colocate the Contacts table component just like [Shadcn-ui/ui's Mail example](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/(app)/examples/mail)

Step 1: Create table.tsx file inside contacts route.

> You could name it contacts-table, but keep in mind, we are already inside contacts/components. It just seemed redundant to have contacts
at this point in the file name.

Step 2: Paste the code inside header.tsx

```
Paste the code from contacts/page.tsx into table.tsx
```

Step 3: Import table in contacts page

Import the table component we just created in the above steps and put it at the line where there was table related code before.
