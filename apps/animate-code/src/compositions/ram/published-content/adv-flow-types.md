!title 1. Introduction to Flow Types and Interfaces in React

```ts ! react/source-code
// Flow Types in React Source Code
// !callout[/Flow Types/] Flow allows you to define types and interfaces, providing strong type-checking in JavaScript code. React relies heavily on Flow types for consistent type safety.

!title 2. Understanding ReactPortal Type in ReactTypes.js

```ts ! react/source-code
// Example of ReactPortal Type Definition
// !callout[/ReactPortal/] React uses the `ReactPortal` type to define how portals work in its rendering engine. This type helps define the structure of a portal, ensuring that Flow can catch errors related to portals.
export type ReactPortal = {
  // The unique identifier for the portal
  $$typeof: symbol | number, 
  // The portal’s key, which helps React identify updates
  key: null | string,         
  // The DOM node or container for the portal
  containerInfo: any,         
  // The children elements rendered inside the portal
  children: ReactNodeList,    
  // Implementation details for cross-rendering environments
  implementation: any,        
};
```

!title 3. Exploring the ThenableImpl Interface

```ts ! react/source-code
// Example of Flow Interface in React
// !callout[/ThenableImpl/] `ThenableImpl` is an interface that React uses for objects with a `then` method, similar to a Promise. This ensures that React APIs that rely on promises work correctly.
interface ThenableImpl<T> {
  then(
    // A function to handle successful resolution
    onFulfill: (value: T) => mixed,  
    // A function to handle errors or rejections
    onReject: (error: mixed) => mixed  
  ): void | Wakeable;
}
```

!title 4. Flow’s Use in Defining Complex Types in React

```ts ! react/source-code
// Defining Complex Types in React with Flow
// !callout[/Complex Types/] React uses Flow to define complex types that are integral to its internal workings. These types ensure strong guarantees on data structures, preventing common JavaScript runtime errors.

!title 5. Flow vs TypeScript for Interfaces and Types

```ts ! react/source-code
// Flow vs TypeScript
// !callout[/Flow vs TypeScript/] Both Flow and TypeScript allow developers to define types and interfaces, but they take different approaches. React continues to use Flow for its flexibility and integration with existing JavaScript codebases.
