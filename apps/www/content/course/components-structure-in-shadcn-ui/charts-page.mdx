description: Components Structure In Charts Page.

In this lesson, we are only focusing on the folder structure, 
file naming conventions used in [Charts page](https://ui.shadcn.com/charts)

## Charts Page

This Charts Page source code is found at [www/app/(app)/charts/page.tsx](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/apps/www/app/(app)/charts/page.tsx).

### Components imported

The following components are imported in the charts page, found at [www/app/(app)/charts/page.tsx](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/apps/www/app/(app)/charts/page.tsx).

```js
import { THEMES } from "@/lib/themes"
import { ChartDisplay } from "@/components/chart-display"
import { ChartsNav } from "@/components/charts-nav"
import { ThemesSwitcher } from "@/components/themes-selector"
import { ThemesStyle } from "@/components/themes-styles"
import { Separator } from "@/registry/new-york/ui/separator"
import * as Charts from "@/app/(app)/charts/charts"
```

There are few observations that can be made here:

- @/components folder:

ChartDisplay, ChartsNav, ThemesSwitcher, ThemesStyle are imported from generic [components folder](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/components) that is at the root level.

You could place the components such as ChartDisplay, ChartsNav in a folder named components 
that could be created in `app/(app)/charts` for colocating purposes. 

- charts components:



## Conclusion:
You make the best judgement based on what works for you. Across the shadcn-ui/ui, components used in pages are located in
components folder at the root level so they can be imported using `@/components`.

We picked the special use cases such as Charts Page, Mail Example page where you will find some components imported from with
in the route folder.
