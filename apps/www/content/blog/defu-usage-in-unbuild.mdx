title: Defu usage in unbuild source code.
---

For this week, I have been reading [unbuild](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild) source code and found few packages that I have never seen before or used. I wanted to share some interesting packages that are used in these OSS projects so we can learn a thing or two ;)

The following are discussed in this article:

1. What is Defu?
    
2. Defu’s usage in unbuild
    

### What is Defu?

Defu is a package built by [authors at Unjs](https://github.com/unjs). Unjs provides JS tools, libraries and has about 63 npm packages and [421m downloads per month](https://unjs.io/packages?q=&order=1&orderBy=title). Sheesh, that’s a lot.

[Defu repository](https://github.com/unjs/defu#readme) has this description “Assign default properties recursively”.

This package is straightforward to use:

#### Install

```js
# yarn
yarn add defu
# npm
npm install defu
# pnpm
pnpm install defu
```

#### Usage

```js
import { defu } from "defu";

console.log(defu({ a: { b: 2 } }, { a: { b: 1, c: 3 } }));
// => { a: { b: 2, c: 3 } }
```

Leftmost arguments have more priority when assigning defaults.

Defu is used to merge objects and the leftmost arguments have precedence as shown in the above example, picked from [Readme](https://github.com/unjs/defu?tab=readme-ov-file#usage).

### Defu’s usage in unbuild

[At line 93 in build.ts](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild/blob/main/src/build.ts#L93), you will find this below code snippet:

```js
// Merge options
  const options = defu(
    buildConfig,
    pkg.unbuild || pkg.build,
    inputConfig,
    preset,
    <BuildOptions>{
      name: (pkg?.name || "").split("/").pop() || "default",
      rootDir,
      entries: [],
      clean: true,
      declaration: undefined,
      outDir: "dist",
      stub: _stubMode,
      stubOptions: {
        /**
         * See https://github.com/unjs/jiti#%EF%B8%8F-options
         */
        jiti: {
          interopDefault: true,
          alias: {},
        },
      },
      watch: _watchMode,
      watchOptions: _watchMode
        ? {
            exclude: "node_modules/**",
            include: "src/**",
          }
        : undefined,
      externals: [
        ...Module.builtinModules,
        ...Module.builtinModules.map((m) => "node:" + m),
      ],
      dependencies: [],
      devDependencies: [],
      peerDependencies: [],
      alias: {},
      replace: {},
      failOnWarn: true,
      sourcemap: false,
      rollup: {
        emitCJS: false,
        watch: false,
        cjsBridge: false,
        inlineDependencies: false,
        preserveDynamicImports: true,
        output: {
          // https://v8.dev/features/import-attributes
          importAttributesKey: "with",
        },
        // Plugins
        replace: {
          preventAssignment: true,
        },
        alias: {},
        resolve: {
          preferBuiltins: true,
        },
        json: {
          preferConst: true,
        },
        commonjs: {
          ignoreTryCatch: true,
        },
        esbuild: { target: "esnext" },
        dts: {
          // https://github.com/Swatinem/rollup-plugin-dts/issues/143
          compilerOptions: { preserveSymlinks: false },
          respectExternal: true,
        },
      },
      parallel: false,
    },
  ) as BuildOptions;
```

this `options` object is large and following the Defu’s definition, all these objects are merged recursively with leftmost arguments taking precedence.

I wonder how this package is different from [lodash.\_merge](https://lodash.com/docs/#merge). Something to explore, I guess.
