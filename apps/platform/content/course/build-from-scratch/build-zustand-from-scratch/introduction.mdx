[Build Zustand from Scratch]

In this course, we build Zustand from scratch using TDD approach.

We gradually add the necessary tooling required in this project.

The approach:
1. Set up a Node project with TypeScript. 

[C: Project Setup]
[L: Create a Node project with TypeScript]
# Challenge

In this challenge, you will have to complete the below tasks:
- Create a Node Project with TypeScript
- Make sure your tsconfig.json matches that of [Zustand's](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/v4.5.5/tsconfig.json) (v4.5.5)

# Solution



[L: Configure vitest]
# Challenge

In this challenge, you will have to complete the below tasks:
- Study the [vitest.config.ts in Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/main/vitest.config.ts).
- Read the Vitest's [Getting Started Guide](https://vitest.dev/guide/).
- Configure Vitest in your project.
- Update your project's vitest.config.ts to match with [Zustand's vitest.config.ts](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/main/vitest.config.ts)

> If you copy over Zustand's vitest.config.ts into your project, please make sure you read the options you pasted so you understand
your configuration.

# Solution

[C: Create a store hook and api object]
[L: Write test]
# Challenge

Now that you have setup your project locally and configured vitest, it is time you write tests first. 

We are taking a TDD approach to build the zustand from scratch, we aim to cover the core functionalities so that you
understand how Zustand's internals work.

In this challenge, you will have to complete the below tasks:

- Head over to [basic.test.tsx](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/main/tests/basic.test.tsx#L21) and analyze the first
test case - 'creates a store hook and api object'.
- Create a folder named tests at the root of your project.
- Create a file named `basic.test.ts`
- Copy and paste the test case - "creates a store hook and api object" into your `basic.test.ts`

[L: Write create API]
[L: Execute test]
