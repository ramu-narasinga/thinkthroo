[C: Lobechat]

Discover page has a lot of sub-routes, we will select some routes as shown in the following and discuss 
the components structure used.

1. Root level file structure
2. Discover/(list) route group file structure
  a. Home sub-route
  b. Assistants sub-route
  c. Models sub-route
3. Chat 


# Root level file structure:

In the [discover folder](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/tree/main/src/app/(main)/discover), we find the below 
files and folder:

```
discover/
├── (detail)/            Route group
├── (list)/              Route group
├── _layout/             Layout folder
├── components/          Commonly used components across Discover list and detail pages
|                        For example, CardBanner in [discover/components/CardBanner.ts](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/app/(main)/discover/components/CardBanner.tsx)
|                        are found to be used in [detail page and list page](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Alobehub%2Flobe-chat%20CardBanner&type=code).
├── features/            features components are found to be in Layout
|                        Example 1: [CreateButton.tsx](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/app/(main)/discover/features/CreateButton/index.tsx) 
|                        usage in Layout.ts in this [search results](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Alobehub%2Flobe-chat%20CreateButton%20&type=code)
|                        Example 2: [useNav.tsx](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/app/(main)/discover/features/useNav.tsx)
|                        usage shown in this [search results](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Alobehub%2Flobe-chat%20useNav&type=code) 
|                        From this example, you will notice that components or hooks in features are only used in layout
|                        and other features folders found in route group.
|                        Example 3: [StoreSearchBar.tsx](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/app/(main)/discover/features/StoreSearchBar.tsx)
|                        usage is shown in this [search results](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Alobehub%2Flobe-chat%20StoreSearchBar&type=code)
|                        This example demonstrates feature usage in Layout only, you can also conclude that features
|                        cannot be used in components but components can be used in features. This observation is made
