[C: State management in creating a new project in Supabase]

In this guide, we analyse how adding a new project in your Supabase dashboard is handled. We 
review the code behind this action and find out how the state is managed once a new project 
is added.

# Where is the Create Project button?

Locating where the "Create Project" button in the Supabase codebase is a good start. On the UI, you
will find this button at the route `/dashboard/projects`.

In the [projects.tsx, at line 171](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/pages/projects.tsx#L71),
you will find this below code:

```js
{!navLayoutV2 && (
  <div className="p-5">
    {IS_PLATFORM && projectCreationEnabled && isSuccess && (
      <HomePageActions
        search={search}
        filterStatus={filterStatus}
        setSearch={setSearch}
        setFilterStatus={setFilterStatus}
        organizations={organizations}
      />
    )}
  </div>
}
```

[HomePageActions.tsx](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/HomePageActions.tsx#L33)
renders this below shown elements.

It is time to locate the code for to "New Project" button. In the [HomePageActions.tsx](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/components/interfaces/HomePageActions.tsx#L47),
you will find this below code snippet - 

```
<DropdownMenu>
    <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>
      <Button type="primary">
        <span>New project</span>
      </Button>
    </DropdownMenuTrigger>
    <DropdownMenuContent side="bottom" align="center">
      <>
        <DropdownMenuLabel>Choose organization</DropdownMenuLabel>
        {organizations
          .sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name))
          .map((x) => (
            <DropdownMenuItem key={x.slug} onClick={() => router.push(`/new/${x.slug}`)}>
              {x.name}
            </DropdownMenuItem>
          ))}
      </>
    </DropdownMenuContent>
</DropdownMenu>
```

When you click on New Project, what you see is a dropdown asking to choose the organization to which you will add
a project. At this point, there is no state management in place. A simple redirect to `/new/x.slug` occurs, here 
x.slug belongs to a organization's slug.

We still haven't learnt what happens after you add a new project, so far we found out that a redirect to 
`/new/{x.slug}` occurs. We now need to find the page.tsx based on this route.

# new/[slug].tsx

Following along the redirect to `/new/[slug].tsx`, we need to find the source code for this page. In the 
[pages/new/[slug].tsx](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/pages/new/%5Bslug%5D.tsx), you
will find the code that renders this route.

This page shows a form and onSubmit, it redirects you to `/project/${res.ref}/building`. This below code snippet
is picked from [/new/[slug].tsx](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/pages/new/%5Bslug%5D.tsx#L371)

```
 return (
    <Form_Shadcn_ {...form}>
      <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
        <Panel
          loading={!isOrganizationsSuccess || isLoadingFreeProjectLimitCheck}
          title={
            <div key="panel-title">
              <h3>Create a new project</h3>
```

[handleSubmit function](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/pages/new/%5Bslug%5D.tsx#L327) 
calls a method named createProject at the end of the function.

```
function onSubmit() {
  // ...
  if (postgresVersion) {
      if (!postgresVersion.match(/1[2-9]\..*/)) {
        toast.error(
          `Invalid Postgres version, should start with a number between 12-19, a dot and additional characters, i.e. 15.2 or 15.2.0-3`
        )
      }

      data['customSupabaseRequest'] = {
        ami: { search_tags: { 'tag:postgresVersion': postgresVersion } },
      }
    }

    createProject(data)
}
```

[createProject function](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/pages/new/%5Bslug%5D.tsx#L180) 
is a mutate function returned by `useProjectCreateMutation` hook. Check out the API layer to learn more about 
these hooks.

```
const {
  mutate: createProject,
  isLoading: isCreatingNewProject,
  isSuccess: isSuccessNewProject,
} = useProjectCreateMutation({
  onSuccess: (res) => {
    router.push(`/project/${res.ref}/building`)
  },
})
```

You add project information such as name etc., and on sumit, you are redirected to a different page. There isn't much 
hassle and no complicated state management.
