title: Using a custom backend server with Next.js in a monorepo.
---

I was searching for an open source repository that schedules and posts on social media. I found [Gitroom](https://github.com/gitroomhq/gitroom/tree/main).

Gitroom is a awesome, built by [Nevo David](https://github.com/nevo-david). You can 📨 schedule social media and articles. Exchange or buy posts from other members 👨🏻‍💻. Monitor your GitHub trending, and so much more 📈.

The following are some interesting things I learnt from this [repository](https://github.com/gitroomhq/gitroom/tree/main)

1\. You can use your own backend with Next.js  
2\. A note about customFetch  
3\. The way the files are named.

# **1\. You can use your own backend with Next.js**

Gitroom uses the following tech stack:

* NX (Monorepo)
    
* NextJS (React)
    
* NestJS
    
* Prisma (Default to PostgreSQL)
    
* Redis
    
* Resend (emails notifications)
    

It has folders named as frontend, backend, cron etc.,

I wondered for quite some time now, if we could use our own backend when you are already using the Next.js, a “full stack” react framework but, I kept seeing people advising to use your custom backend when you need advanced features like cron, web sockets etc., on Reddit.

Now that I found Gitroom that demonstrates the custom backend usage along with Next.js and cron, I have a good feeling that you could learn some advanced patterns studying this repository.

# **2\. A note about customFetch**

The following code snippet is picked from [apps/frontend/src/app/(site)/settings/page.tsx#L21](https://github.com/gitroomhq/gitroom/blob/e7b669f1253e3ef7ae6b9cc9d2f1d529ea86b288/apps/frontend/src/app/\(site\)/settings/page.tsx#L21)

```plaintext
if (searchParams.code) {
  await internalFetch('/settings/github', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ code: searchParams.code }),
  });
  
  return redirect('/settings', RedirectType.replace);
}
```

‘internalFetch’ uses customFetch.

The below code snippet is picked from [libraries/helpers/src/utils/custom.fetch.func.ts](https://github.com/gitroomhq/gitroom/blob/e7b669f1253e3ef7ae6b9cc9d2f1d529ea86b288/libraries/helpers/src/utils/custom.fetch.func.ts#L10)

```plaintext
export const customFetch = (
 params: Params,
 auth?: string,
 showorg?: string
 ) => {
 return async function newFetch(url: string, options: RequestInit = {}) {
   const newRequestObject = await params?.beforeRequest?.(url, options);
   const fetchRequest = await fetch(params.baseUrl + url, {
   credentials: 'include',
   …(newRequestObject || options),
   headers: {
   …(auth ? { auth } : {}),
   …(showorg ? { showorg } : {}),
   …(options.body instanceof FormData
   ? {}
   : { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }),
   Accept: 'application/json',
   …options?.headers,
   },
   // @ts-ignore
   …(!options.next && options.cache !== 'force-cache'
   ? { cache: options.cache || 'no-store' }
   : {}),
 });

if (
 !params?.afterRequest ||
 (await params?.afterRequest?.(url, options, fetchRequest))
 ) {
   return fetchRequest;
 }
// @ts-ignore
   return new Promise((res) => {}) as Response;
   };
};
```

Why???, I don’t know the answer yet but, I can tell there is “beforeRequest” and “afterRequest” processing happening based on the above code snippet

# **3\. The way the files are named.**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:825/1*ienhHi1o5R89ivR7Xgtf6A.png)

I have never seen a service file named using dots like “custom.fetch.func.ts”. Sure, there’s config files named as tailwind.config.ts etc.,

Here’s what chatGPT has to say about this:  
“  
This kind of naming does not fit into a traditional case style like snake\_case, kebab-case, or camelCase.

However, if we ignore the file extension (“.ts”) and consider only “custom.fetch.func,” it can be seen as:

Dot notation: This isn’t a standard case style but is sometimes used in programming to represent a hierarchical relationship or to namespace parts of a name.  
“

To be honest, choose w/e naming conventions work for you. I use lowercase words separated by dashes as a file name, like custom-fetch-func.ts
