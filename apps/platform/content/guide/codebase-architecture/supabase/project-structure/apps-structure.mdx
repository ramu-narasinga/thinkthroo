[L: apps structure]
Let's look at an overview of the [apps folder structure in Supabase]https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/apps).

```sh
design-system              # May be code prototypes? I am not sure, could not find a site where this is hosted.
|
docs                       # Microfrontend hosted at https://supabase.com/docs
|
studio                     # Microfrontend hosted at https://supabase.com/dashboard
