# **What is Danger.js?**

Danger runs during your CI process, and gives your team the chance to automate common code review chores such as enforcing changelogs, encouraging smaller PRs, show useful info on a PR.

This provides another logical step in your build, through this Danger can help lint your rote tasks in daily code review.

Danger leaves messages inside your PRs based on rules that you create with JavaScript or TypeScript.

Over time, as rules are adhered to, the message is amended to reflect the current state of the code review.

From the looks of [react/dangerfile.js](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/dangerfile.js), React uses this file mainly to compute critical built size changes.

```plaintext
const {markdown, danger, warn} = require('danger');
```

This import is found at the top of the file. Let’s find out what these functions are and how they are used in react/dangerfile.js.

markdown and warn, these are the functions which you use in rules to provide feedback during code review. Assuming Danger has access to write a comment, then `warn`and `markdown` will report directly inline.

```plaintext
// Adds raw markdown into the Danger comment, under the table
markdown(message: MarkdownString, file?: string, line?: number) => void

// Highlights low-priority issues, but does not fail the build. Message is shown inside a HTML table.
warn(message: MarkdownString, file?: string, line?: number) => void
```

markdown is used at the end of the file
