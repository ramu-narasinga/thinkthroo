!title 1. What is Flow?

```js ! flow.org/docs/quickstart
// What is Flow?
// !callout[/flow/] Flow is a static type checker for JavaScript, designed to catch common errors in your codebase by analyzing your codeâ€™s type annotations.
@flow
```

!title 2. Adding Flow to a JavaScript Project

```js ! flow.org/docs/quickstart
// Adding Flow to a project
// !callout[/@flow/] To enable Flow in a JavaScript file, you need to add the `@flow` comment at the top of your file. This tells Flow to check this file for type errors.
@flow
```

```js ! react/source-code
// Example of enabling Flow in a React project
/**

 *
 * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the
 * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
 * @flow
 */
// !callout[/type/] In React source code, Flow is enabled in specific files using the `@flow` comment, allowing static type checking across various components.
import type {
  ReactNodeList,
  Thenable,
  PendingThenable,
  FulfilledThenable,
  RejectedThenable,
} from 'shared/ReactTypes';
```

!title 3. Handling Special Cases with $FlowFixMe

```js ! react/source-code
// Example of $FlowFixMe usage in React
// !callout[/exampleFunction/] Flow sometimes fails to infer types correctly, especially in legacy code or edge cases. React uses `$FlowFixMe` to silence Flow errors in certain parts of the code.
function exampleFunction(obj) {
  // $FlowFixMe
  return obj['invalid-key'];
}
```

!title 4. Using $FlowFixMe[invalid-computed-prop]

```js ! react/source-code
// Handling computed property Flow error
// !callout[/exampleObject/] When Flow detects an invalid computed property, React developers use `$FlowFixMe[invalid-computed-prop]` to bypass the error in certain cases. This is useful when refactoring large codebases.
const exampleObject = {
  // $FlowFixMe[invalid-computed-prop]
  [someKey]: 'value',
};
```

!title 5. Types and Interfaces in React Source Code (ReactTypes.js)

```ts ! react/source-code
// Types and Interfaces in React
// !callout[/ReactPortal/] React uses Flow types to define objects like ReactPortal, ensuring static type safety across components.
export type ReactPortal = {
  $$typeof: symbol | number,
  key: null | string,
  containerInfo: any,
  children: ReactNodeList,
  implementation: any, // For cross-renderer implementation
};
```

!title 6. Flow vs TypeScript: Understanding the DX

```ts ! react/source-code
// Flow vs TypeScript DX
// !callout[/TypeScript/] While both Flow and TypeScript provide type-checking for JavaScript, Flow was introduced in 2014 (two years after TypeScript). Many large projects, including React, still use Flow due to its flexibility and integration with existing JavaScript codebases.
