# State management in Cal.com

In this guide, we will analyse how the state is managed in Cal.com.

We have to take a closer look at operations such as:
1. Bookings listing page
2. Event types listing page
3. Add/Edit a new event type
4. Add/Edit availability

These operations are specific to Cal.com, these operations vary based on an application. 
In Lobechat, to understand how how state is managed, you would look at operations such as add a new 
assistant, loading a chat etc.,

At the time of writing this guide, Cal.com used pages route and with a migration in place to use 
app router. Through out these guides, you will see references pointing at pages router. Be sure to check 
out the [future folder in cal.com source](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/tree/main/apps/web/app/future)
as this shows the migration towards app folder.
