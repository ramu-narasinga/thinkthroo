title: codecov.yml in Lobechat source code.

In this article, we analyze [codecov.yml found in Lobechat repository](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/codecov.yml) I have seen codecov.yml in a lot of open source projects. So what is codecov.yml?

# **codecov.yml**

Codecov by Sentry is the all-in-one code coverage and quality solution for any test suite — giving developers  
actionable insights to deploy reliable code with confidence. Trusted by over 29,000 organizations.

Check out the [codecov’s quick start guide](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/quick-start).

# **codecov.yml in Lobechat**

The below code snippet is picked from [Lobechat](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/codecov.yml).

```plaintext
coverage:
 status:
 project:
 default: off
 server:
 flags:
 - server
 app:
 flags:
 - app
 patch: off
```

By default, Codecov will only show git diff coverage checks on a PR but it looks like Lobechat turned this off since the default is off. Check this guide, [Set project coverage checks on a pull request](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/common-recipe-list#set-project-coverage-checks-on-a-pull-request), for more info.

For the server and the app, it has the flags, I found this [documentation for flags on codecov](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/flags).

You can group coverage reports based on type of tests or sub-projects/teams based on flags.

Flags allow you to isolate and categorize coverage reports for different tests and features in your project. This is particularly helpful if:  
1\. You have multiple types of tests (e.g., unit, integration, frontend, backend, etc) AND/OR  
2\. You’re employing a monorepo setup where you’d like to encapsulate each project’s test coverage independently.

This [pull request](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/pull/4394) has Codecov report. Here is an example of [reports with flags](https://app.codecov.io/gh/lobehub/lobe-chat/pull/4394/flags?src=pr&el=flag&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=lobehub).
