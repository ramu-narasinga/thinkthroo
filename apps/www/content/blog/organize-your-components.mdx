When building a Next.js application, organizing your components and layouts efficiently is crucial for maintaining a clean, scalable codebase. In this blog post, we will look at a practical example of structuring your components and layouts using a page-based approach, inspired by [Supabase’s codebase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/pages/sign-in.tsx).

# **Understanding the Page-Based Approach**

Next.js uses a pages directory where each file corresponds to a route in your application. This structure is intuitive, but as your app grows, it is very important to organize components and layouts in a way that promotes reusability and clarity.

## **Example: Sign-In Page Structure**

Let’s look at real-world example by examining the structure of a `SignInPage` component in [Supabase source code](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/pages/sign-in.tsx).

# **Components and Layouts: A Clear Separation**

Notice how the components and layouts are organized:

* `components/interfaces/SignIn/SignInForm`: This directory holds the `SignInForm` component, specifically related to the Sign-In interface. By organizing components within a relevant interface folder, you ensure that related components are grouped together, making them easier to find and manage.
    
* `components/layouts/SignInLayout/SignInLayout`: The `SignInLayout` component is separated into its own layout directory. This keeps the layout logic distinct from the individual components, allowing you to reuse the layout across different pages.
    
* `lib/constants`: The `IS_PLATFORM` constant is imported from a centralized location. This is a good practice for managing global constants that might be used across multiple components.

In fact, [Supabase component folder](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/apps/studio/components) has a good explanation about this approach.

# **Adding the Layout**

One of the strengths of Next.js is its ability to define layouts on a [per-page basis](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#per-page-layouts). The `SignInPage` component is wrapped in a `SignInLayout` that defines the overall structure of the page:

```plaintext
SignInPage.getLayout = (page) => (
  <SignInLayout
    heading="Welcome back"
    subheading="Sign in to your account"
    logoLinkToMarketingSite={true}
  >
    {page}
  </SignInLayout>
)

export default SignInPage
```

# **Conclusion**

Organizing your components and layouts in a pages-based Next.js application this way promotes a clean, scalable structure. By grouping related components and separating layout logic, you create a maintainable codebase that’s easy to extend as your application grows.
