title: Toolbar's setCursorMode in Grida codebase explained.
toc: true
---

In this article, we will review a function called setCursorMode in Grida source code. To provide more context, you will see this function in [Toolbar component](https://github.com/gridaco/grida/blob/ac377ecdc20355ce1526a209078df353b4ba97b2/apps/forms/scaffolds/playground-canvas/toolbar.tsx#L175C9-L186C11) on the Grida Canvas page.

Toolbar is used to draw elements on the canvas. This below code snippet is picked from [Toolbar.tsx](https://github.com/gridaco/grida/blob/ac377ecdc20355ce1526a209078df353b4ba97b2/apps/forms/scaffolds/playground-canvas/toolbar.tsx#L175C9-L186C11)

```js
<ToolsGroup
  value={value}
  options={[
    { value: "rectangle", label: "Rectangle", shortcut: "R" },
    { value: "ellipse", label: "Ellipse", shortcut: "O" },
    { value: "line", label: "Line", shortcut: "L" },
    { value: "image", label: "Image" },
  ]}
  onValueChange={(v) => {
    setCursorMode(toolbar_value_to_cursormode(v as ToolbarToolType));
  }}
/>
```

setCursorMode is called in the onValueChange function. At this point, we need to understand:

* What does setCursorMode do?
    

### What does setCursorMode do?

To understand what setCursorMode does, we first need to look at where this function is imported from. The below code is picked from [line 140 in toolbar.tsx](https://github.com/gridaco/grida/blob/ac377ecdc20355ce1526a209078df353b4ba97b2/apps/forms/scaffolds/playground-canvas/toolbar.tsx#L140)

```js
  const { setCursorMode, cursor_mode } = useEventTarget();
```

useEventTarget is a hook in [provider.tsx](https://github.com/gridaco/grida/blob/main/apps/forms/grida-react-canvas/provider.tsx#L2087). Below code is picked from [line 2107 in provider.tsx](https://github.com/gridaco/grida/blob/main/apps/forms/grida-react-canvas/provider.tsx#L2107)

```js
const setCursorMode = useCallback(
    (cursor_mode: CursorMode) => {
      dispatch({
        type: "surface/cursor-mode",
        cursor_mode,
      });
    },
    [dispatch]
);
```

setCursorMode does one thing, that is to call dispatch function with a object containing type and cursor mode.

dispatch is a function [destructured from \_useInternal](https://github.com/gridaco/grida/blob/main/apps/forms/grida-react-canvas/provider.tsx#L2088C3-L2088C45).

```js
const [state, dispatch] = __useInternal();
```

In the upcoming articles, we will review this \_\_useInternal and the function `toolbar_value_to_cursormode`.
