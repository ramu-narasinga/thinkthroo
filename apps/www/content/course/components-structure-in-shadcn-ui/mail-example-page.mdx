description: Components Structure In Mail Example Page.
---

In this lesson, we are only focusing on the folder structure, file naming conventions and 
how the Mail Example Page is built.

## Mail Example Page

This Mail Example Page source code is found at [www/app/(app)/examples/mail](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/(app)/examples/mail).

### Components imported

The following components are imported in the mail page, found at [www/app/(app)/examples/mail](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/apps/www/app/(app)/examples/mail/page.tsx).

```js
import { Mail } from "@/app/(app)/examples/mail/components/mail"
import { accounts, mails } from "@/app/(app)/examples/mail/data"
```

There are few observations that can be made here:

- Mail component
Mail component seems to be imported from mail/components. What does this tell you? components specific to a page are 
colocated with in examples/mail folder. In the previous lesson, we mentioned about components folder that contains components
that can be used across the app.

There are some more components imported in [www/app/(app)/examples/mail/components/mail](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/(app)/examples/mail/components)

```js
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import { Input } from "@/registry/new-york/ui/input"
import {
  ResizableHandle,
  ResizablePanel,
  ResizablePanelGroup,
} from "@/registry/new-york/ui/resizable"
import { Separator } from "@/registry/new-york/ui/separator"
import {
  Tabs,
  TabsContent,
  TabsList,
  TabsTrigger,
} from "@/registry/new-york/ui/tabs"
import { TooltipProvider } from "@/registry/new-york/ui/tooltip"
import { AccountSwitcher } from "@/app/(app)/examples/mail/components/account-switcher"
import { MailDisplay } from "@/app/(app)/examples/mail/components/mail-display"
import { MailList } from "@/app/(app)/examples/mail/components/mail-list"
import { Nav } from "@/app/(app)/examples/mail/components/nav"
import { type Mail } from "@/app/(app)/examples/mail/data"
import { useMail } from "@/app/(app)/examples/mail/use-mail"
```
Remember, our focus is on folder structure.

- @/registry/new-york/ui:
@/registry/new-york/ui is used in the shadcn-ui/ui codebase to reuse ui blocks. this ui folder is automatically generated when 
you install shadcn-ui/ui via CLI

- `examples/mail/components/` folder:
This folder contains the following files:
1. account-switcher.tsx
2. mail-display.tsx
3. mail-list.tsx
4. mail.tsx
5. nav.tsx

mail.tsx is the base of MailPage as it imports the other building blocks/components to form the Mail Page.

- data folder
This [data file](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/apps/www/app/(app)/examples/mail/data.tsx) contains static data 
that is used in Mail Example page. You could write your server data fetching actions in a file like this that is specific to 
a page, colocated with in a folder, like in this case "mail" as this is related to Mail page.  

- use-mail.ts custom hook:
You will also a find a custom hook, [use-mail.ts](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/apps/www/app/(app)/examples/mail/use-mail.ts)
This hook uses Jotai to manage state.
