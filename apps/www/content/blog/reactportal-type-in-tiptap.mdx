title: ReactPortal type in TipTap source code.
---

In this article, we will review the ReactPortal type in [TipTap source code](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/blob/develop/packages/react/src/Editor.ts#L2).

The below code is picked from [tiptap/packages/react/src/Editor.js](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/blob/develop/packages/react/src/Editor.ts#L2)

```js
import { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'
import { ReactPortal } from 'react'

import { ReactRenderer } from './ReactRenderer.js'

export type EditorWithContentComponent = Editor & { contentComponent?: ContentComponent | null }
export type ContentComponent = {
  setRenderer(id: string, renderer: ReactRenderer): void;
  removeRenderer(id: string): void;
  subscribe: (callback: () => void) => () => void;
  getSnapshot: () => Record<string, ReactPortal>;
  getServerSnapshot: () => Record<string, ReactPortal>;
}
```

`ReactPortal` is used as a type here in getSnapshot. This getSnapshot function is supposed to return a value of type `Record<string, ReactPortal>`. Similar declaration is found for `getServerSnapshot`.

I have seen this “portal” related code in the wild before but I could not recall. When I googled “Portal in React”, I found [createPortal in React documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal).

But is createPortal related to ReactPortal type? what is `createPortal` anyway? createPortal lets you render some children into a different part of the DOM.

Below is a simple example picked from React docs.

```js
import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div style={{ border: '2px solid black' }}>
      <p>This child is placed in the parent div.</p>
      {createPortal(
        <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>,
        document.body
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

I liked this [example related to showing modal](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal#rendering-a-modal-dialog-with-a-portal) more.

I really was hoping to find that this function returns a value of type `ReactPortal`. I mean, it’s got matching word “Portal” but to my surprise, in the [documentation it is mentioned](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal#returns) that `createPortal` returns a value of type, ReactNode.

It is also worth mentioning that `createPortal` is imported from `react-dom`, whereas `ReactPortal` is imported from `react`. createPortal is a function and ReactPortal is a type.
