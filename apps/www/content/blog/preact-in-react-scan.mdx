title: Preact usage in react-scan source code.
---

In this article, we analyze how Preact is used in react-scan source code. 

### What is Preact?

Preact is a fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API. There is a [Preact tutorial](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/tutorial) available. 

#### Preact’s Goals

Preact aims to deliver on a few key goals:

* **Performance:** Render quickly & efficiently
    
* **Size:** Small size, lightweight *(approximately 3.5 kB)*
    
* **Efficiency:** Effective memory usage *(avoiding GC thrash)*
    
* **Understandability:** Understanding the codebase should take no more than a few hours
    
* **Compatibility:** Preact aims to be *largely compatible* with the React API. [preact/compat](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/switching-to-preact) attempts to achieve as much compatibility with React as possible.
    

Read more about [Preact goals](https://preactjs.com/about/project-goals/) and what features are [intentionally omitted in Preact](https://preactjs.com/about/project-goals/).

Now that we understand what Preact is, let’s see how this library is used in react-scan source code.

### Preact import in react-scan source code

It looks like only the types, ComponentType and ReactNode, are imported in a file, [packages/scan/src/core/index.ts](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan/blob/main/packages/scan/src/core/index.ts#L9). 

I did search for Preact in the react-scan codebase and it is used in a lot of other files too. Approximately in 38 files at the time of writing this article.

I did not stop my research here, I wanted to find out if react-scan used react at all because you see it as a dependency in its [package.json](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan/blob/244f7c4741083944268753f299115703005f47e6/packages/scan/package.json#L281)

```plaintext
"devDependencies": {
    ...
    "react": "*",
    "react-dom": "*",
    "react-router": "^5.0.0"
```

But if you search carefully to find any imports from “react”, you will find nothing but one import in the react-scan package.

[constants.ts](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan/blob/244f7c4741083944268753f299115703005f47e6/packages/scan/src/core/monitor/constants.ts#L15) is the only file where there’s an import from “react”.
