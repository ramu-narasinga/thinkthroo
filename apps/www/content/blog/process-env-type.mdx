title: ProcessEnv type in next-runtime-env source code

In this article, we analyse the ProcessEnv type found in [next-runtime-env source code](https://github.com/expatfile/next-runtime-env/blob/development/src/typings/process-env.ts#L3) and review the [StackOverflow answe](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45194598/using-process-env-in-typescript)r and also [Matt Pocock’s article](https://www.totaltypescript.com/how-to-strongly-type-process-env).

### ProcessEnv type

ProcessEnv is imported as shown below

```ts
import { ProcessEnv } from '../typings/process-env';
```

In the [typings/process-env](https://github.com/expatfile/next-runtime-env/blob/development/src/typings/process-env.ts#L3), you will find the below code:

```ts
import { type Dict } from './dict';
export type ProcessEnv = Dict<string>;
```

It is a Dict of type string, but Dict type is imported from `/dict` and has the below code

```ts
export type Dict<T> = {
 [key: string]: T | undefined;
};
```

### Matt Pococok’s article

In the Total TypeScript article — [How to strongly type process.env](https://www.totaltypescript.com/how-to-strongly-type-process-env),  
it is stated that “a common problem in TypeScript is that process.env doesn’t give you autocomplete for the environment variables that actually exist in your system” and Matt suggests two solutions:

\- [Augment the global type](https://www.totaltypescript.com/how-to-strongly-type-process-env#solution-1-augment-the-global-type)  
\- [Validate at Runtime with t3-env](https://www.totaltypescript.com/how-to-strongly-type-process-env#solution-2-validate-it-at-runtime-with-t3-env)

> These approaches do not mention anything about defining your ProcessEnv types, but you will see this suggestion/accepted answer on Stackoverflow. Read further to find out.

### Stackoverflow Accepted Answer

There was a [question titled — using process.env in TypeScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45194598/using-process-env-in-typescript) on Stackverflow. It has 21 answers but I like the accepted answer more and you will similar approach in next-runtime-env source code.

The [accepted answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45195359) tells you to define a ProcessEnv type with the below code:

```ts
export interface ProcessEnv {
 [key: string]: string | undefined
}
```

next-runtime-env has the same type, only difference is, the defined type is assigned to a variable named `Dict`.

```ts
import { type Dict } from './dict';
export type ProcessEnv = Dict<string>;
```

Dict type:

```ts
export type Dict<T> = {
 [key: string]: T | undefined;
};
```
