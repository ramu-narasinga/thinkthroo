title: pretty-bytes usage in unbuild source code
---

For this week, I have been reading [unbuild](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild) source code and found few packages that I have never seen before or used. I wanted to share some interesting packages that are used in these OSS projects so we can learn a thing or two ;)

The following are discussed in this article:

1. What is pretty-bytes?
    
2. pretty-bytes usage in unbuild

### What is pretty-bytes?

[pretty-bytes is written by Sindre](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pretty-bytes). It converts bytes to a human readable string: 1337 → 1.34 kB.

#### Install

```js
npm install pretty-bytes
```

#### Usage

```js
import prettyBytes from 'pretty-bytes';

prettyBytes(1337);
//=> '1.34 kB'

prettyBytes(100);
//=> '100 B'

// Display with units of bits
prettyBytes(1337, {bits: true});
//=> '1.34 kbit'

// Display file size differences
prettyBytes(42, {signed: true});
//=> '+42 B'

// Localized output using German locale
prettyBytes(1337, {locale: 'de'});
//=> '1,34 kB'
```

### pretty-bytes usage in unbuild

pretty-bytes is found to be [at line 10 in build.ts](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild/blob/main/src/build.ts#L10).

```js
import prettyBytes from "pretty-bytes";
```

[Then at line 332](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild/blob/main/src/build.ts#L332C5-L342C11), you will find this below code:

```js
let line =
      `  ${colors.bold(rPath(entry.path))} (` +
      [
        totalBytes && `total size: ${colors.cyan(prettyBytes(totalBytes))}`,
        entry.bytes && `chunk size: ${colors.cyan(prettyBytes(entry.bytes))}`,
        entry.exports?.length &&
          `exports: ${colors.gray(entry.exports.join(", "))}`,
      ]
        .filter(Boolean)
        .join(", ") +
      ")";
```

pretty-bytes is applied to get human readable string, in this case, it is used to report total size, chunk size.
