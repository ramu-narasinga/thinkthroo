### Oxlint is a linter

[oxc-project](https://github.com/oxc-project) is an organization that provides a collection of JavaScript tools written in Rust. Oxlint is a linter.

The below information is picked from [oxc docs](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter).

> Oxlint is designed to catch erroneous or useless code without requiring any configurations by default.

> Note: 

> At the current stage, oxlint is not intended to fully replace ESLint; it serves as an enhancement when ESLint’s slowness becomes a bottleneck in your workflow.

> We recommend running oxlint before ESLint in your lint-staged or CI setup for a quicker feedback loop, considering it only takes a few seconds to run on large codebases.

#### Features

* 50–100 times faster than ESLint, and scales with the number of CPU cores ([benchmark](https://github.com/oxc-project/bench-javascript-linter)).
    
* Over 480 rules with a growing list from `eslint`, `typescript`, `eslint-plugin-react`, `eslint-plugin-jest`, `eslint-plugin-unicorn`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` and [many more](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/481).
    
* Supports
    

1. [.eslintignore](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/ignore#the-eslintignore-file).
    
2. [ESLint comment disabling](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#disabling-rules).
    
3. [Partial ESLint v8 Configuration](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/config) in `json` format
