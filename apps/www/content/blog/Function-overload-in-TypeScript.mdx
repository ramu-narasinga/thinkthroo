title: Function overload in TypeScript
---

When working with TypeScript, you may encounter situations where a function needs to handle different types of input while maintaining type safety. This is where function overloading comes into play. Let’s look at a practical example of function overloading, inspired by a code snippet from the [Supabase source code](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/hooks/misc/useIsFeatureEnabled.ts#L24).

# **Example: useIsFeatureEnabled**

The [`useIsFeatureEnabled`](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/hooks/misc/useIsFeatureEnabled.ts#L24) function is a great example of function overloading. It can handle both an array of features and a single feature, returning appropriate results for each case.

Here’s the overloaded function definition:

```plaintext
function useIsFeatureEnabled<T extends Feature[]>(
  features: T
): { [key in FeatureToCamelCase<T[number]>]: boolean }
function useIsFeatureEnabled(features: Feature): boolean
function useIsFeatureEnabled<T extends Feature | Feature[]>(features: T) {
  const { profile } = useProfile()

  if (Array.isArray(features)) {
      return Object.fromEntries(
        features.map((feature) => [
          featureToCamelCase(feature),
          checkFeature(feature, profile?.disabled_features),
        ])
      )
  }
  return checkFeature(features, profile?.disabled_features)
}
export { useIsFeatureEnabled }
```

# **How It Works**

1. **Function Overloads**: The first two declarations are overload signatures. They define the different ways the function can be called. The actual implementation comes last, handling both cases.
    
2. **Implementation**: The function implementation checks if the input `features` is an array. If it is, it processes each feature, converts it to camelCase, and checks if it's enabled. If `features` is a single feature, it directly checks its status.
    

# **Supporting Functions and Types**

To understand this better, let’s look at the supporting `checkFeature` function and the type utility `FeatureToCamelCase`.

## **checkFeature Function**

The `checkFeature` function determines if a given feature is enabled or not:

```plaintext
function checkFeature(feature: Feature, features?: Feature[]) {
  return !features?.includes(feature) ?? true
}
```

This function returns `true` if the feature is not in the disabled features list or if no disabled features are provided.

# **Conclusion**

Function overloading in TypeScript allows you to define multiple ways to call a function with different types of input while ensuring type safety. The `useIsFeatureEnabled` function from Supabase is an excellent example of this concept in action. It demonstrates how to handle different input types seamlessly, providing both flexibility and strong typing.
