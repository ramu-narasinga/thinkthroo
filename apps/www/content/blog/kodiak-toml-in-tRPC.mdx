# **kodiak.yaml in trpc repository:**

The below code snippet is picked from [.kodiak.toml](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/next/.kodiak.toml)

```plaintext
# .kodiak.toml
version = 1
[approve]
auto_approve_usernames = ["dependabot", "renovate"]
[merge]
method = "squash"
automerge_label = ["üöÄ merge", "‚¨ÜÔ∏è dependencies"]
[merge.automerge_dependencies]
# only auto merge "minor" and "patch" version upgrades.
versions = ["minor", "patch"]
usernames = ["dependabot", "renovate"]
[update]
autoupdate_label = "‚ôªÔ∏è autoupdate"
```

Let‚Äôs now refer to the documentation based on this configuration file. The first option is [approve](https://kodiakhq.com/docs/config-reference#approveauto_approve_usernames). If a PR is opened by a user with a username in the approve.auto\_approve\_usernames list, Kodiak will automatically add an approval to the PR. Read more about [approve](https://kodiakhq.com/docs/config-reference#approveauto_approve_usernames).

Next option in above file is merge. It has two variables set, `method` and `automerge_label`. Label your pull request with the kodiak: merge.method = ‚Äòrebase‚Äô label, for example, to set merge.method to ‚Äúrebase‚Äù for your pull request. Read more about [merge](https://kodiakhq.com/docs/config-reference#mergemethod-1). [automerge\_label](https://kodiakhq.com/docs/config-reference#mergeautomerge_label) is a label to enable Kodiak to merge a PR. Kodiak can only merge pull requests passing your GitHub branch protection rules.If multiple labels are specified in an array, any of the specified labels will trigger merge.

```plaintext
[merge.automerge_dependencies]
# only auto merge "minor" and "patch" version upgrades.
versions = ["minor", "patch"]
usernames = ["dependabot", "renovate"]
```

Kodiak will only automerge dependency upgrades for pull request authors in this list. Check out [automerge\_dependenciesusernames](https://kodiakhq.com/docs/config-reference#mergeautomerge_dependenciesusernames).

```plaintext
[update]
autoupdate_label = "‚ôªÔ∏è autoupdate"
```

Pull requests with the update.autoupdate\_label will be updated when they are out-of-date with their base branch.

configuration options.
