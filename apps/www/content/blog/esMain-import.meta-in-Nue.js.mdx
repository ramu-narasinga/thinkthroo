title: esMain(import.meta) in Nue-js source code.
---

In this article, we will review a function, esMain(), in Nue.js source code. You will find the below code snippet at [line 127 in packages/nuekit/cli.js](https://github.com/nuejs/nue/blob/master/packages/nuekit/src/cli.js#L127).

```plaintext
// Only run main when called as real CLI
if (esMain(import.meta)) {
```

What caught my attention is this comment below:

> // Only run main when called as real CLI

I was thinking how does this check happen? To understand that we need to see the esMain function code. It is located in [packages/nuekit/src/util.js](https://github.com/nuejs/nue/blob/master/packages/nuekit/src/util.js#L16).

```plaintext
export function esMain(meta) {
  if (!meta || !process.argv[1]) return false
  return fileURLToPath(
    meta.resolve(process.argv[1])) === fileURLToPath(meta.url
  )
}
```

Let’s break this down. I would start with finding out what [import.meta](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import.meta) is.

#### import.meta

The `import.meta` meta-property exposes context-specific metadata to a JavaScript module. It contains information about the module, such as the module's URL.

Read more about [import.meta](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import.meta).

TLDR: import.meta is created by the host environment and the object looks something like below:

```plaintext
{
  // In browsers, this is either the URL from which the script was obtained 
  // (for external scripts), or the URL of the containing document 
  // (for inline scripts). In Node.js, this is the file path (including the 
  // file:// protocol).
  "url": <value>, // ()
  // Resolves a module specifier to a URL 
  // using the current module's URL as base.
  "resolve": 
}
```

So if there is not meta or process.argv\[1\], this esMain function returns false.

```plaintext
if (!meta || !process.argv[1]) return false
```

otherwise, the below code is executed:

```plaintext
return fileURLToPath(
  meta.resolve(process.argv[1])
) === fileURLToPath(meta.url)
```

fileURLToPath is imported from “node:url” at the top of this file as shown below:

```plaintext
import { fileURLToPath, pathToFileURL } from 'node:url'
```
