title: Hookable package in unbuild source code.

---

For this week, I have been reading [unbuild](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild) source code and found few packages that I have never seen before or used. I wanted to share some interesting packages that are used in these OSS projects so we can learn a thing or two ;)

The following are discussed in this article:

1. What is hookable?
    
2. Hookable’s usage in unbuild
    

### What is hookable?

Hookable is a package built by [authors at Unjs](https://github.com/unjs). Unjs provides JS tools, libraries and has about 63 npm packages and [421m downloads per month](https://unjs.io/packages?q=&order=1&orderBy=title). Sheesh, that’s a lot.

[Hookable repository](https://github.com/unjs/hookable) has this description “Awaitable Hooks”.

This package is straightforward to use:

#### Install

```plaintext
npm install hookable
```

#### Usage

```plaintext
// Method A:
import { createHooks } from 'hookable'

// Create a hookable instance
const hooks = createHooks()

// Hook on 'hello'
hooks.hook('hello', () => { console.log('Hello World' )})

// Call 'hello' hook
hooks.callHook('hello')
```

Basically, you create a hook with a callback and call these hooks somewhere else in your codebase to trigger this callback. Let’s what sort of hooks are found in unbuild source code.

### Hookable’s usage in unbuild

#### Initializing hookable

[At line 182 in build.ts](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild/blob/main/src/build.ts#L182), you will find the below code:

```plaintext
// Build context
  const ctx: BuildContext = {
    options,
    jiti,
    warnings: new Set(),
    pkg,
    buildEntries: [],
    usedImports: new Set(),
    hooks: createHooks(),
  };
```

#### Register hooks

[At the line 185 in build.ts](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild/blob/main/src/build.ts#L185), you will find the below code:

```plaintext
// Register hooks
  if (preset.hooks) {
    ctx.hooks.addHooks(preset.hooks);
  }
  if (inputConfig.hooks) {
    ctx.hooks.addHooks(inputConfig.hooks);
  }
  if (buildConfig.hooks) {
    ctx.hooks.addHooks(buildConfig.hooks);
  }
```

#### Calling the hooks

I[n build.ts](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild/blob/main/src/build.ts#L197), you will find the below code used to call registered hooks:

```plaintext
// Allow prepare and extending context
await ctx.hooks.callHook("build:prepare", ctx);
// Call build:before
await ctx.hooks.callHook("build:before", ctx);
// Skip rest for stub and watch mode
if (options.stub || options.watch) {
  await ctx.hooks.callHook("build:done", ctx);
  return;
}
// Call build:done
await ctx.hooks.callHook("build:done", ctx);
```
