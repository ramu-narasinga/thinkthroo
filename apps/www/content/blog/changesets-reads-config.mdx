title: How Changsets reads config.json internally
---

When you initialise Changesets via the CLI using init command, this command sets up the .changeset folder. It generates a readme and a config file. The config file includes the default options, as well as comments   
on what these options represent.

The default config.json generated by init command looks like below:

```plaintext
{
 "commit": false,
 "updateInternalDependencies": "patch",
 "linked": [],
 "access": "restricted",
 "baseBranch": "master",
 "ignore": [],
 "changelog": "@changesets/cli/changelog"
}
```

Read more about config.json [here](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/config-file-options.md).

Now that we understand what a config.json is for in using Changesets, let’s look at how CLI package reads this config.json.

In the run function, this try catch block is found:

```plaintext
try {
 config = await read(cwd, packages);
} catch (e) {
 let oldConfigExists = await fs.pathExists(
 path.resolve(cwd, ".changeset/config.js")
 );
```

`read` function is part of another package named [config](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/packages/config/src/index.ts#L94).

As you can see from the above image, `fs.readJSON` is used in combination with path.join that combines cwd + .changesets + “config.json”

parse accepts this config.json read as its first argument and this parse function is a really long function that performs additional operations using this json and packages (second argument).
