title: Jiti usage in Docusaurus source code.
---

For this week, I have been reading [unbuild](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild) source code and found few packages that I have never seen before or used. I wanted to share some interesting packages that are used in these OSS projects so we can learn a thing or two ;)

The following are discussed in this article:

1. What is Jiti?
    
2. Jiti’s usage in Docusaurus

### What is Jiti?

Jiti is a package built by [authors at Unjs](https://github.com/unjs). Unjs provides JS tools, libraries and has about 63 npm packages and [421m downloads per month](https://unjs.io/packages?q=&order=1&orderBy=title). Sheesh, that’s a lot.

[Jiti repository](https://github.com/unjs/jiti#readme) has this description “Runtime TypeScript and ESM support for Node.js”. Okay, what does this mean? To understand more about this tool, I looked at the features it offers:

* Seamless TypeScript and ESM syntax support for Node.js
    
* Seamless interoperability between ESM and CommonJS
    
* Asynchronous API to replace `import()`
    
* Synchronous API to replace `require()` (deprecated)
    
* Super slim and zero dependency
    
* Custom resolve aliases
    
* Smart syntax detection to avoid extra transforms
    
* Node.js native `require.cache` integration
    
* Filesystem transpile with hard disk caches
    
* ESM Loader support
    
* JSX support (opt-in)
    

Sure enough, it has features that I do not understand yet, the one feature that rings a bell for me is the ***Seamless interoperability between ESM and CommonJS*** because I have seen this in dynamic imports in OSS projects where a file is defined using CommonJS (module.exports) required in an file using ESM syntax (export default) but still not sure if what I saw back then has any resemblance to what Jiti offers. I am interested to learn more about this package, may be in the future.

But let’s review Jiti’s usage in Open Source projects such as Docusaurus and Unbuild

### Jiti’s usage in Docusaurus

I found the below code related to Jiti in the [Docusaurus — moduleUtils.js](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/71d682c53b2f6bcb2e70c86dde79cbb7c581e9a8/packages/docusaurus-utils/src/moduleUtils.ts#L21)

```js
import jiti from 'jiti';

/*
jiti is able to load ESM, CJS, JSON, TS modules
 */
export async function loadFreshModule(modulePath: string): Promise<unknown> {
  try {
    if (typeof modulePath !== 'string') {
      throw new Error(
        logger.interpolate`Invalid module path of type name=${modulePath}`,
      );
    }
    const load = jiti(__filename, {
      // Transpilation cache, can be safely enabled
      cache: true,
      // Bypass Node.js runtime require cache
      // Same as "import-fresh" package we used previously
      requireCache: false,
      // Only take into consideration the default export
      // For now we don't need named exports
      // This also helps normalize return value for both CJS/ESM/TS modules
      interopDefault: true,
      // debug: true,
    });

    return load(modulePath);
```

Let’s get the hint from the comments — “***jiti is able to load ESM, CJS, JSON, TS modules***”, this would be the interoperability feature. jiti is imported and directly called as a function with some parameters for additional configuration and it has comments explaining what the configuration is for.

```js
// Transpilation cache, can be safely enabled
cache: true,
// Bypass Node.js runtime require cache
// Same as "import-fresh" package we used previously
requireCache: false,
// Only take into consideration the default export
// For now we don't need named exports
// This also helps normalize return value for both CJS/ESM/TS modules
interopDefault: true,
// debug: true,
```

I also found this [note in Docusaurus migration guide](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/71d682c53b2f6bcb2e70c86dde79cbb7c581e9a8/website/docs/migration/v3.mdx#L759):

> New Config Loader

> Docusaurus v3 changes its internal config loading library from [`import-fresh`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/import-fresh) to [`jiti`](https://github.com/unjs/jiti). It is responsible for loading files such as `docusaurus.config.js` or `sidebars.js`, and Docusaurus plugins.

> :::info How to upgrade

> In theory, you have nothing to do, and your existing config files should keep working as before.

> However, this is a major dependency swap and subtle behavior changes could occur.
