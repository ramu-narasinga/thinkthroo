# What's API Layer?
In the context of web applications, API layer means communicating with your server to get/mutate data.
Inspired by [Bulletproof React's API Layer](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/api-layer.md)
We analyze the API Layer in the [Lobechat](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/tree/main). 

# Lobe Chat API Layer
To study the API Layer, we pick a page on https://chat-preview.lobehub.com/ and look at the source code except we are
narrowing down our expedition to focus on the API Layer.

# Concepts you will learn:
You will be learning the API layer used in the Lobe Chat. 
Read through this guide to understand how Lobe Chat's API layer works.

## Data fetched in Discover Home Page
1. [Discover Home Page]
(https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/app/(main)/discover/(list)/(home)/page.tsx)
2. [DiscoverService](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/server/services/discover/index.ts#L27)

In this guide, we will find out how the API layer is implemented in Discover page. You will learn how the data is fetched
in the Discover page.

[Insert a screenshot of Discover page - https://lobechat.com/discover]

Discover page has Home, Assistants, Plugins etc., tabs. For this guide, let's pick assistants tab and 
find out how the data is fetched.

In the [Discover page.tsx](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/app/(main)/discover/(list)/(home)/page.tsx),
You will find the below code snippet.

```
const discoverService = new DiscoverService();
const assistantList = await discoverService.getAssistantList(locale);
const pluginList = await discoverService.getPluginList(locale);
const modelList = await discoverService.getModelList(locale);
```
### DiscoverService

[DiscoverService](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/server/services/discover/index.ts#L52) is class that is
instantiated using `new DiscoverService()`. You could also just export the functions from a service file but using a class
in a service helps you organize your functions better as your functions are encapsulated in a class. This approach also make it
easy to mock your service for testing purposes. 

### discoverService.getAssistantList(locale)

```
getAssistantList = async (locale: Locales): Promise<DiscoverAssistantItem[]> => {
    let res = await fetch(this.assistantStore.getAgentIndexUrl(locale), {
      next: { revalidate },
    });

    if (!res.ok) {
      res = await fetch(this.assistantStore.getAgentIndexUrl(DEFAULT_LANG), {
        next: { revalidate },
      });
    }

    if (!res.ok) return [];

    const json = await res.json();

    return json.agents;
};
```
This above code snippet is picked from [getAssistantList](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/server/services/discover/index.ts#L52)

This function uses [fetch](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch). Next.js extends the native Web 
fetch() API to allow each request on the server to set its own persistent caching semantics.

Let's understand what this second param in the above fetch does.
```
{
  next: { revalidate },
}
```
[options.next.revalidate](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch#optionsnextrevalidate) from the 
Next.js documentation.

Set the cache lifetime of a resource (in seconds).
1. false - Cache the resource indefinitely. Semantically equivalent to revalidate: Infinity. The HTTP cache may evict older resources over time.
2. 0 - Prevent the resource from being cached.
3. number - (in seconds) Specify the resource should have a cache lifetime of at most n seconds.

so where's revalidate value coming from in [Discover service](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/server/services/discover/index.ts#L25)?
revalidate is initialized at L25:

```
const revalidate: number = 3600;
```
This 3600 is in seconds which is 1 hour. getAssistantList has a cache lifetime of at most 1 hour.

`assistantStore.getAgentIndexUrl` returns the URL used in the fetch API.

## Data fetched in Chat Page

Data fetched in the Chat page is different to what you have seen in getAssistantList in discover service. 
getAssistantList uses fetch, where as Chat uses `useSWR`. Let's find out how this is done.

[insert screenshot of lobechat chat session page]

You will find useFetchSessions hook in [SessionListContent/DefaultMode.tsx](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/app/(main)/chat/%40session/features/SessionListContent/DefaultMode.tsx#L29)
useFetchSession is in useSessionStore. API layer is tightly coupled with state management in Lobechat. We want to focus
only on API layer, check out the [state management in lobechat](link to lobechat state management).

[Insert screenshot of https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/app/(main)/chat/%40session/features/SessionListContent/DefaultMode.tsx#L29]

## useFetchSessions in session store:
You will find the below code for the useFetchSessions in [session/action.ts](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/store/session/slices/session/action.ts#L200)

```
useFetchSessions: (isLogin) =>
    useClientDataSWR<ChatSessionList>(
      [FETCH_SESSIONS_KEY, isLogin],
      () => sessionService.getGroupedSessions(),
      {
        fallbackData: {
          sessionGroups: [],
          sessions: [],
        },
        onSuccess: (data) => {
          if (
            get().isSessionsFirstFetchFinished &&
            isEqual(get().sessions, data.sessions) &&
            isEqual(get().sessionGroups, data.sessionGroups)
          )
            return;

          get().internal_processSessions(
            data.sessions,
            data.sessionGroups,
            n('useFetchSessions/updateData') as any,
          );
          set({ isSessionsFirstFetchFinished: true }, false, n('useFetchSessions/onSuccess', data));
        },
        suspense: true,
      },
    ),
```

Looks compicated, let's break it down. It uses:

1. useClientDataSWR

useClientDataSWR is imported from [libs/swr/index.ts](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/libs/swr/index.ts#L22C14-L22C30)

```
export const useClientDataSWR: SWRHook = (key, fetch, config) =>
  useSWR(key, fetch, {
    // default is 2000ms ,it makes the user's quick switch don't work correctly.
    // Cause issue like this: https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/issues/532
    // we need to set it to 0.
    dedupingInterval: 0,
    focusThrottleInterval: 5 * 60 * 1000,
    refreshWhenOffline: false,
    revalidateOnFocus: true,
    revalidateOnReconnect: true,
    ...config,
  });
```

useSWR is a React hook for data fetching provided by [Vercel's SWR API](https://swr.vercel.app/).
The name ‚ÄúSWR‚Äù is derived from stale-while-revalidate, a HTTP cache invalidation strategy popularized by 
HTTP RFC 5861(opens in a new tab). SWR is a strategy to first return the data from cache (stale), then send 
the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data.   

Let's now understand what each of these options do by referring to the documentation:
a. dedupingInterval

[SWR Docs](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/api#parameters) mentions this - dedupingInterval = 2000: dedupe requests with the same key in this time span in milliseconds 

but Lobechat has this configured to 0 and it explains why with a nice comment.

```
// default is 2000ms ,it makes the user's quick switch don't work correctly.
// Cause issue like this: https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/issues/532
// we need to set it to 0.
dedupingInterval: 0,
```
just in case, if you were wondering what dedupe means, it is about removing duplicates.

b. focusThrottleInterval:

[SWR docs](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/api#parameters) provides this information about focusThrottleInterval - 
focusThrottleInterval = 5000: only revalidate once during a time span in milliseconds

In the context of useSWR, the focusThrottleInterval option controls how frequently the data revalidation 
happens when the window or tab regains focus.

### ChatGPT's explanation:

Explanation in the useSWR context:
SWR's behavior with focus: By default, SWR will revalidate (i.e., refetch) the data whenever the user 
switches back to the app or tab (when the window or tab regains focus). This is useful because it ensures that 
the data displayed is up-to-date when the user returns to the app.

focusThrottleInterval = 5000: This option tells SWR to throttle the revalidation when focus changes. 
Specifically, it will revalidate data at most once every 5000 milliseconds (or 5 seconds).

If a user quickly switches between tabs or focuses on the app multiple times in rapid succession, 
SWR will ensure that revalidation only happens once within that 5-second window, preventing excessive 
or redundant requests.

What's the value that lobechat uses?
```
focusThrottleInterval: 5 * 60 * 1000
```
Converting 5 * 60 * 1000 milliseconds, it is 5 minutes. What this means is that when you focus by revisiting lobechat
application, data is not refreshed until 5 minutes but by then you would visit different pages, differen chats 
and latest data might load already but that depends on the actions that you perform.

c. refreshWhenOffline:

### SWR documentation explanation:
refreshWhenOffline = false: polling when the browser is offline 
(determined by navigator.onLine), Read more about [refreshWhenOffline](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/api#parameters)

### ChatGPT explanation:
SWR offers an option to periodically refetch data in the background (polling), but when the browser 
goes offline, trying to fetch data may be pointless. To prevent unnecessary requests, setting 
`refreshWhenOffline = false` ensures polling is paused when the browser is offline, 
saving resources and avoiding failed fetch attempts.

### What's the value that lobechat uses?

```
refreshWhenOffline: false
```

d. revalidateOnFocus:

### SWR documentation explanation:
revalidateOnFocus = true: automatically revalidate when window gets focused ([details](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/revalidation))

### ChatGPT explanation:
- Revalidate: In SWR, "revalidate" refers to refetching data from the source (e.g., an API) 
to ensure the data is still up-to-date.
- Focus events: In web applications, a "focus" event occurs when the user returns to the browser window or tab, 
either after switching tabs, windows, or after minimizing and reopening the app.
- revalidateOnFocus = true: This setting enables the app to automatically revalidate (refetch data) every time
the user switches back to the tab. By default, this is set to true in SWR, meaning the data will be refreshed every time the tab regains focus.

### What's the value that lobechat uses?

```
revalidateOnFocus: true,
```

d. revalidateOnReconnect:

### SWR documentation explanation:
revalidateOnReconnect = true: automatically revalidate when the browser regains a network connection (via navigator.onLine) ([details](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/revalidation))

### ChatGPT explanation:

- Revalidate: In SWR, revalidation refers to refetching data from the server to ensure it's up-to-date.
- Reconnect: This event happens when the browser loses and then regains internet connectivity. The browser 
detects this change using the navigator.onLine property:
true: Browser is online (connected to the internet).
false: Browser is offline (disconnected from the internet).
- revalidateOnReconnect = true: This setting ensures that whenever the browser switches from an offline state back to an 
online state, SWR will automatically refetch the data.

### What's the value that lobechat uses?

```
revalidateOnReconnect: true
```
