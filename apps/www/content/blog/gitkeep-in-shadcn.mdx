title: .gitkeep file in Shadcn/ui source code
---

I came across a file named .gitkeep whille studying Shadcn/ui source code and I wanted to share what it is about in this article.

We look at the following:

1. What is .gitkeep file?
    
2. Where do you find .gitkeep in shadcn/ui codebase?
    

### What is .gitkeep file?

Git only tracks files not directories, so when you create empty directories and push, these empty directories are not pushed to your repository unless you have some file in it.

To solve this problem, you could simple add a dummy file in your directories and push it and have the latest directory structure reflected on your Github repo or you could simple just add a .gitkeep file and leave this file blank.

There is no special meaning to this .gitkeep file than to just sync your local directory structure with your Github repository.

Now that we understand what a .gitkeep is, let’s find out where you could find this file in Shadcn/ui codebase.

### Where do you find .gitkeep in shadcn/ui codebase?

There are few directories in which I found this .gitkeep file.

#### pages/api

In this [pages/api](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/pages/api), it has this below shown structure

#### pages 

In the [pages folder](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/apps/www/pages), you will find the below structure

#### **registry**

Although this directory is automatically generated using scripts in the shadcn/ui codebase, it still has this .gitkeep

Let’s go back to the original definition of .gitkeep. When there’s an empty directory, to sync the folder structure with your Github repo, you create this file .gitkeep but after the initial push with empty dirs would you still need to have this .gitkeep folder? I personally don’t think its needed to have .gitkeep file even though your directory is no longer empty.
