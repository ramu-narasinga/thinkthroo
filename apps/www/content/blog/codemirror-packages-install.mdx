title: How CodeMirror v6 dev setup installs packages without a monorepo
---

In the previous articles, we looked at:  
1\. How CodeMirror v6 setup command processes CLI arguments?  
2\. How CodeMirror v6 dev setup retrieves packages without a monorepo

This leads to the next question how are packages installed as part development environment setup without using a monorepo. [install function](https://github.com/codemirror/dev/blob/main/bin/cm.js#L81) is called using apply as explained in the previous articles mentioned above.

```js
let base = arg == " - ssh" ? "git@github.com:codemirror/" : "https://github.com/codemirror/"
if (arg && arg != " - ssh") help(1)
```

In case you are wondeirng what these 2 lines are for, Github lets you clone a repository via the ssh, hence this scenaria is handled to set the correct base url.

```js
for (let pkg of packages) {
 if (fs.existsSync(pkg.dir)) {
   console.warn(`Skipping cloning of ${pkg.name} (directory exists)`)
 } else {
   let origin = base + (pkg.name == "codemirror" ? "basic-setup" : pkg.name) + ".git"
   run("git", ["clone", origin, pkg.dir])
 }
}
```

If a package already exists, it is checked via existsSync and console.warn is shown about it being skipped otherwise, origin is assigned a value using base with a .git extension, since this is a URL there is no point in using API such as join as that is applicable to file system and the run function is called.

### run function

```js
function run(cmd, args, wd = root, { shell = false } = {}) {
 return child.execFileSync(cmd, args, {shell, cwd: wd, encoding: "utf8", stdio: ["ignore", "pipe", process.stderr]})
}
```

run functions seems to be using execFileSync API provided by `child`. `child` is initialized at the top of the file.

```js
const child = require("child_process")
```

We need to understand what child\_process and execFileSync API are.

#### child\_process

The node:child\_process module provides the ability to spawn subprocesses in a manner that is similar, but not identical, to popen. This capability is primarily provided by the child\_process.spawn() function:

```js
const { spawn } = require('node:child_process');
const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);
ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
 console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
});
ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
 console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
});
ls.on('close', (code) => {
 console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
});
```

This above information is picked from [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child-process)

#### execFileSync

The child\_process.execFileSync() method is generally identical to child\_process.execFile() with theexception that the method will not return until the child process has fully closed. When a timeout has been encountered and killSignal is sent, the method won’t return until the process has completely exited.

If the child process intercepts and handles the SIGTERM signal and does not exit, the parent process will still wait until the child process has exited.

If the process times out or has a non-zero exit code, this method will throw an Error that will include the full result of the underlying child\_process.spawnSync().

If the shell option is enabled, do not pass unsanitized user input to this function. Any input containing shell metacharacters may be used to trigger arbitrary command execution.

```js
const { execFileSync } = require('node:child_process');
try {
 const stdout = execFileSync('my-script.sh', ['my-arg'], {
 // Capture stdout and stderr from child process. Overrides the
 // default behavior of streaming child stderr to the parent stderr
 stdio: 'pipe',
// Use utf8 encoding for stdio pipes
 encoding: 'utf8',
 });
console.log(stdout);
} catch (err) {
 if (err.code) {
 // Spawning child process failed
 console.error(err.code);
 } else {
 // Child was spawned but exited with non-zero exit code
 // Error contains any stdout and stderr from the child
 const { stdout, stderr } = err;
console.error({ stdout, stderr });
 }
}
```

This above information is picked from [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_processexecfilesyncfile-args-options)

Now that we understand what this API is used for, we can now look at the run function from CodeMirror.

```js
function run(cmd, args, wd = root, { shell = false } = {}) {
 return child.execFileSync(cmd, args, {shell, cwd: wd, encoding: "utf8", stdio: ["ignore", "pipe", process.stderr]})
}
```

execFileSync executes the cmd (command) passed in as the first parameter. Install function calls run using the below variables.

```js
run("git", ["clone", origin, pkg.dir])
```

Here the command is git and args is an array — \[“clone”, origin, pkg.dir\]. Install function basically clones the packages that are public repositories in the CodeMirror organization. Executing the commands programattically reminds me of two related concepts:  
1\. \[Execa\]([https://www.npmjs.com/package/execa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/execa))  
2\. \[Degit\]([https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit))
