title: WeakSet() in react-scan source code.
---

In this article, we review a code snippet from [react-scan source code](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan/blob/main/packages/scan/src/core/index.ts#L609).

```plaintext
export const ignoredProps = new WeakSet<
  Exclude<ReactNode, undefined | null | string | number | boolean | bigint>
>();

export const ignoreScan = (node: ReactNode) => {
  if (node && typeof node === 'object') {
    ignoredProps.add(node);
  }
};
```

I found this code snippet in a file, [core/index.ts](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan/blob/main/packages/scan/src/core/index.ts#L609). Why not use a proper Set? why would react-scan author decide to use WeakSet? To draw some conclusion around that, we first need to understand difference between WeakSet and Set in JavaScript.

### WeakSet

A `WeakSet` is a collection of garbage-collectable values, including objects and [non-registered symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol#shared_symbols_in_the_global_symbol_registry). A value in the `WeakSet` may only occur once. It is unique in the `WeakSet`'s collection.

Read more about [WeakSet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakSet).

### Set

The `Set` object lets you store unique values of any type, whether [primitive values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) or object references.

### WeakSet vs Set

Values of WeakSets must be garbage-collectable. Most [primitive data types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) can be arbitrarily created and don’t have a lifetime, so they cannot be stored. Objects and [non-registered symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol#shared_symbols_in_the_global_symbol_registry) can be stored because they are garbage-collectable.

The main differences to the [`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) object are:

* `WeakSet`s are collections of objects and symbols only. They cannot contain arbitrary values of any type, as [`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)s can.
    
* The `WeakSet` is *weak*, meaning references to objects in a `WeakSet` are held *weakly*. If no other references to a value stored in the `WeakSet` exist, those values can be garbage collected.
    

Coming back to the code snippet in react-scan

```plaintext
export const ignoreScan = (node: ReactNode) => {
  if (node && typeof node === 'object') {
    ignoredProps.add(node);
  }
};
```

Now it makes sense why typeof node === ‘object’ check is in place. Can you guess why? this is because only Object and Symbols can be stored in the WeakMap that are garbage collectable if they are not referenced elsewhere.
