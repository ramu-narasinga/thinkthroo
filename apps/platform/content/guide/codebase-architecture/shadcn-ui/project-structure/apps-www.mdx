[L: apps/www Structure]

This workspace structure is different to what you find in CRUD based Next.js app. Shadcn/ui provides 
reusable components that you can copy/paste and also install these components via CLI. This is the 
workspace used to build the [Shadcn/ui website](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

Since this usecase does not involve any database as there is no authentication or to save user information, 
Shadcn/ui has the below structure in `www` workspace:

This apps/www workspace structure as follows:

```
__registry__           # Files inside this directory are autogenerated by ./scripts/build-registry.ts
|
actions                # Contains edit-in-v0 button that makes API calls using fetch
|
app                    # app folder contains route groups, components, pages, layouts 
|
assets/fonts           # assets/fonts contains the fonts used in Shadcn/ui
| 
components             # Contains the components that are used across the pages inside the app folder
|
config                 # Contains site.ts that has the meta information and docs.ts to configure the docs
|
content/docs           # Contains content for the documentation, this gets rendered statically on https://ui.shadcn.com/docs
|
hooks                  # Contains hook files that are used across the app
|
lib                    # lib folder has the helper functions such as charts.ts, toc.ts etc that perform crucial operations
|
pages/api              # Contains api that sends a components.json
|
public                 # Contains static asstes such as images, site.webmanifest, favicon etc.,
|
registry               # This folder is very important and is used in scripts/build-registry to __registry__ that is used in CLI
|
scripts                # scripts folder has files such as build-registry, capture-registry and fix-import. These are used in scripts in package.json
|
styles                 # Contains styles such as globals.css and mdx.css 
|
types                  # Contains types such as nav.ts, uninst.ts
```

Shadcn/ui does not use tRPC or database, it does have pages/api but that sends a components.json via 
a GET request and is found to be using fetch to make external calls to v0.
