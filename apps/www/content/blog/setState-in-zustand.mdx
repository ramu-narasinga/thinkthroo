title: setState in Zustand source code.
toc: true

In this article, I will provide a review on how setState in Zustand’s source code is written/works. This concept leverages closures in JavaScript and arrow functions.

[StoreApi](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/main/src/vanilla.ts#L9) type is straight forward.

```javascript
export interface StoreApi<T> {
  setState: SetStateInternal<T>
  getState: () => T
  getInitialState: () => T
  subscribe: (listener: (state: T, prevState: T) => void) => () => void
}
```

setState accepts two parameters

1. partial 
    
2. replace
    

Let’s perform an experiment using the example demo app provided in theZustand repo.

I added some console statements in the dist to see what’s in partial and replace.

And this is what the values are when you update the count in the demo example.

Since partial is a function here, 

```javascript
const nextState = typeof partial === "function" ? partial(state) : partial;
```

If you look closely, state is initialised when you createStore and is outside the setState function. Does that ring a bell? Refer to [Closures in Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).

`partial` is an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)

```javascript
(state)=>({
    count: state.count + 1
})
```

The beauty is that you can call these functions with a parameter since it returns a function, that is why we have `partial(state)` and state is outside the setState. setState has access to this state variable, thanks to closures in JavaScript.

You can run the below code snippet in a browser console and it logs what you sent as a parameter.

```javascript
(a => console.log(a))("test")
// Output: test
```

I wrote detailed articles about Object.is and Object.assign usage. Since replace is null,

```javascript
if (!Object.is(nextState, state)) {
  const previousState = state
  state =
    (replace ?? (typeof nextState !== 'object' || nextState === null))
      ? (nextState as TState)
      : Object.assign({}, state, nextState)
  listeners.forEach((listener) => listener(state, previousState))
}
```

State is updated using Object.assign. We will look at an advanced use case where replace is not null and understand how setState behaves in the future articles.
