[Architecture: Shadcn/ui Project Structure]
[L: Introduction]

Shadcn/ui provides beautifully designed accessible, customizable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

Shadcn/ui codebase size is decent, not as large as the likes of Supabase, Cal.com, Lobechat. In this guide, you will learn the project structure 
used in [Shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui).

Inspired by 
[Bulletproof-react's Project Structure](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md), 
We provide an overview of the project's folder structure.

Shadcn/ui is a monorepo and uses [Turborepo build system](https://turbo.build/repo/docs)

In this guide, we study the project structure in this order:
- [apps/www](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www)
- [packages](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/packages)
- [scripts](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/scripts)
- [templates/next-template](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/templates/next-template)

You will find additional tooling and configuration at the root level, 
these are analyzed and documented in [Shadcn/ui tooling](link-to-tooling).
