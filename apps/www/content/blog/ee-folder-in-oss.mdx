title: What's the `ee` folder in open-source projects?
toc: true
---

In this article, we analyse the ee folder found in open-source projects. This is closely linked to the open-source licensing. There’s a difference between Open source and source code available. You will find a [better explanation in this article](https://danb.me/blog/open-source-available-distinction/).

Open-source/source code available project licenses must be adhered to. An open-source/source code available project’s license is decided by the original author/team who built their project. It takes a lot of time and efforts to produce these open-source projects, hence you must respect the licensing in place.

I am going to provide a couple of projects that contain ee folder that has a different license compared to the rest of the other parts of those projects.

### Enterprise Edition

ee stands for Enterprise Edition.

#### ee folder in Cal.com

Cal.com is a great example for this. In [api/v2/ee folder](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/d6fe955ea8826c8a426fe2b6fdf9b48a8d290dd5/apps/api/v2/src/ee/README.md?plain=1#L12), you will find the below content:

“  
\# Enterprise Edition of API

Welcome to the Enterprise Edition (“/ee”) of the Cal.com API.

Our philosophy is simple, all “Singleplayer APIs” are open-source under AGPLv3.   
All “Multiplayer APIs” are under a commercial license.

The \[/ee\]([https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/tree/main/apps/api/v2/ee](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/tree/main/apps/api/v2/ee)) subfolder is the place  
for all the **Enterprise Edition** features from our \[hosted\]([https://cal.com/pricing](https://cal.com/pricing)) plan   
and enterprise-grade features for \[Enterprise\]([https://cal.com/enterprise](https://cal.com/enterprise)) such as SSO,   
SAML, OIDC, SCIM, SIEM and much more or \[Platform\]([https://cal.com/platform](https://cal.com/platform)) plan to build   
a marketplace.

\&gt; *❗ WARNING: This repository is copyrighted (unlike our \[main repo\](*[*https://github.com/calcom/cal.com*](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)*)).   
You are not allowed to use this code to host your own version of app.cal.com without obtaining a   
proper \[license\](*[*https://console.cal.com/*](https://console.cal.com/)*) first❗*  
“

> You are not allowed to use this code to host your own version of app.cal.com without obtaining a proper \[license\]([https://console.cal.com/](https://console.cal.com/)) first❗

You have to tread carefully when you see such type of warnings, the right thing to do here would be to just contact cal.com if you decide to host your own version.

#### ee folder in Documenso

I will provide some excerpts found in [packages/ee/LICENSE](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/blob/e6d4005cd14599c3a5571edd43182cb2b2f34b40/packages/ee/LICENSE) regaridng ee licensing. Be sure to check that LICENSE.
