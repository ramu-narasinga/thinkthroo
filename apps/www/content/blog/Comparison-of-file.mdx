title: Comparison of file and component structures among Shadcn-ui, Plane.so and Gitroom.
---

In this article, we will look at folder structures in Shadcn-ui, Plane.so and Gitroom used to organise a Next.js project.

# **Shadcn-ui file and component structures:**

## **File structure**

[Shadcn-ui/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/apps/www/app/\(app\)/examples/dashboard/page.tsx) uses app router and has a [Router group named (app)](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/\(app\)).

In the (app) folder, you will find a folder with page.tsx and/or layout.tsx in some routes such as [colors](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/\(app\)/colors), [blocks](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/\(app\)/blocks), [docs](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/\(app\)/docs).

## **Component structure**

In [blocks/page.tsx](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/apps/www/app/\(app\)/blocks/page.tsx), you will find that it imports components that are generic or that can be reused in other pages.

But wait, there’s other kind of components.

If you look at [examples route](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/\(app\)/examples), each example has its own component that is specific to an example.

so there’s components available at [examples/card/components](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/app/\(app\)/examples/cards/components) and then there are also [generic components](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/apps/www/components) that can be reused.

# **Plane.so file and component structures:**

[plane.so](https://github.com/makeplane/plane/tree/preview) has similar structure to that shadcn-ui/ui where you will find components specific to features by their names as shown below.

## **File structure**

The file structure in [plane.so](https://plane.so/) uses nested routes but it does have a header.tsx specific to a route defined in all the folders along with page.tsx or layout.tsx

## **Component structure**

All the components used in the app router are placed inside [core folder](https://github.com/makeplane/plane/tree/preview/web/core).

So now comes the question, how come we see the imports as “@/components” in a router as shown below:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*SEr4u4d9ckp2s7TuEJ9t7A.png)

when there is no components folder at app folder level:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:853/1*DbYeDx_b3hK6eyDYg7tSCg.png)

Well, the components are inside core folder and tsconfig.json has the paths defined to locate the folders in core as base.

# **Gitroom file and component structures:**

Gitroom has a straight forward structure. Routes have page.tsx and each page.tsx uses components from components folder and this components folder contains files specific to features.

## **File structure:**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*lOM1G3JZiWbRDfsCYc0gbQ.png)

As you can see, router only has one file name page.tsx and that’s it. We see in shadcn-ui where it contains components specific to a route that are scoped to that route, similarly in plane.so, it has route specific header.tsx along with page.tsx however, one commonality in all of these projects is that there is a components folder that can be reused or specific to a feature depending on the folder name.

## **Component structure:**

Notice how the route/file structures has the folder names that match with some of the folders names in component structure.
