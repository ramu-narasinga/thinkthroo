title: Bypass bundlers detection of the require statement

In this article, we analyse how React source code bypasses bundlers’ detection of require statement.

By concatenating the string “require” with a random number (Math.random()), the code generates a string that looks like “require”, but is not directly recognizable by the bundler during static analysis. The string is then sliced to get the first 7 characters, ensuring that the result is always “require” (since “require” + Math.random() will result in something like “require0.123456”, which is sliced to “require”).

All this trouble to invoke a MacroTask called setImmediate that is available in Node environment.

# **setImmediate**

When you want to execute some piece of code asynchronously,  
but as soon as possible, one option is to use the setImmediate() function provided by Node.js:

```plaintext
setImmediate(() => {
 // run something
});
```

Any function passed as the setImmediate() argument is a callback that’s executed in the next iteration of the event loop.

Read more about setImmediate at [Nodejs Docs](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/asynchronous-work/understanding-setimmediate).

# **Why avoid bundlers detecting require?**

## **Browser environments don’t need Node.js modules:**

React needs to differentiate between the Node.js environment (where setImmediate is used) and the browser environment (where MessageChannel is used). If a bundler detects require, it might automatically include a Node.js polyfill in the browser bundle, which is unnecessary and can bloat the code.

## **Avoid accidental polyfill inclusion:**

Bundlers, like Webpack, often include polyfills for Node.js APIs when they detect require. This is problematic for a lightweight library like React, where such polyfills are unnecessary and may interfere with React’s own logic for handling environments (browser vs. Node.js).

This enqueueTask is a fallback method used in [ReactAct.js](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/5d19e1c8d1a6c0b5cd7532d43b707191eaf105b7/packages/react/src/ReactAct.js)

```plaintext
// $FlowFixMe[invalid-computed-prop]
const nodeRequire = module && module[requireString];
// assuming we're in node, let's try to get node's
// version of setImmediate, bypassing fake timers if any.
enqueueTaskImpl = nodeRequire.call(module, 'timers').setImmediate;
```

`timers` is a core module in Node.js. It provides a set of timer functions that can be used to schedule code execution at specific intervals or after a delay. These functions are similar to the global timer functions in  
JavaScript (like setTimeout and setInterval), but they are provided as part of the timers module for additional control and precision.

```plaintext
nodeRequire.call(module, 'timers')
```
