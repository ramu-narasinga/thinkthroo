title: sizereport.config.js in Preact source code.  
---

I found a file named [sizereport.config.js in Preact source code](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/main/sizereport.config.js) and it has the below code.

```plaintext
module.exports = {
 repo: 'preactjs/preact',
 path: ['./{compat,debug,hooks,}/dist/**/!(*.map)'],
 branch: 'main'
};
```

I was trying to find where this config is used, but I couldn’t yet. Below are the [search results](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Apreactjs%2Fpreact%20report&type=code):

Instead I found something else. There is a [size.yml in the .github folder](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/main/.github/workflows/size.yml)

### size.yml

```plaintext
name: Compressed Size

on:
  workflow_call:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: 'package.json'
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: '**/package-lock.json'
      - uses: preactjs/compressed-size-action@v2
        with:
          repo-token: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
          # Our `prepare` script already builds the app post-install,
          # building it again would be redundant
          build-script: 'npm run --if-present noop'
```

This size workflow action contains this above code. It uses preactjs/compressed-size-action@v2. [compressed-sized-action is another repository.](https://github.com/preactjs/compressed-size-action/tree/master)

### Compressed Size Action

A GitHub action that reports changes in compressed file sizes on your PRs.

* Automatically uses `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`, or `npm ci` when lockfiles are present
    
* Builds your PR, then builds the target and compares between the two
    
* Doesn’t upload anything or rely on centralized storage
    
* Supports [custom build scripts](https://github.com/preactjs/compressed-size-action/tree/master#customizing-the-build) and [file patterns](https://github.com/preactjs/compressed-size-action/tree/master#customizing-the-list-of-files)
