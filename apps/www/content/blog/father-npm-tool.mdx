title: Father, an NPM package development tool.

In this article, we review a tool called [Father](https://github.com/umijs/father). I pulled this below information from the Father repository [README.md](https://github.com/umijs/father). Although, their README is in Chinese, I will be submitting a PR with a docs translation in the near future.

I found a file named [.fatherrc.ts](https://github.com/arvinxx/zustand-utils/blob/master/.fatherrc.ts) in a package named [zustand-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zustand-utils). This zustand-utils is used in [Lobechat source code](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/446db7a203dc81082aac8ac0a4a6a604453eb7c0/src/store/serverConfig/store.ts#L2).

The below code is picked from [.fatherrc.ts](https://github.com/arvinxx/zustand-utils/blob/master/.fatherrc.ts)

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'father';

export default defineConfig({
  esm: { output: 'es' },
  cjs: { output: 'lib', platform: 'browser' },
});
```

defineConfig is imported from ‘father’. This is even when I had to search for “father” npm package.

# **What is “Father” package?**

Father is an NPM package development tool that helps developers efficiently and reliably develop NPM packages, generate build artifacts, and publish them. It offers the following key features:

* **Dual-mode Build**: Supports both **Bundless** and **Bundle** build modes — ESModule and CommonJS outputs use Bundless mode, while UMD outputs use Bundle mode.
    
* **Multiple Build Engine**s: Bundle mode uses **Webpac**k as the build engine, while Bundless mode supports **esbuild, Babel, and SW**C, allowing flexible configuration switching.
    
* **Type Generatio**n: Supports generating `.d.t`s type definitions for TypeScript modules, whether for source code builds or dependency pre-bundling.
    
* **Persistent Caching**: All output types support persistent caching, enabling faster incremental builds.
    
* **Project Inspection**: Checks for common pitfalls in NPM package development to ensure more stable releases.
    
* **Micro Generators**: Adds commonly used engineering capabilities to projects, such as setting up Jest for testing.
    
* **Dependency Pre-Bundling**: Provides out-of-the-box dependency pre-bundling to improve the stability of Node.js frameworks/libraries and prevent issues caused by upstream dependency updates (experimental).
    

# **Quick start guide**

Use `create-father` to quickly create a new **Father** project:

```javascript
npx create-father my-father-project
```

This template includes only the basic configuration. For additional configuration options, refer to the **Configuration** documentation.

To build the project, run:

```javascript
npx father build
```

After the build completes, check the `dist` folder to see the generated output.

# **Configuration**

You could create a file named [.fatherrc.ts](https://github.com/arvinxx/zustand-utils/blob/master/.fatherrc.ts) and set up your configuration. Read more about [father configuration](https://github.com/umijs/father/blob/master/docs/config.md).

> [*config.md*](https://github.com/umijs/father/blob/master/docs/config.md) *is in Chinese language, I have submitted a PR with English translations.*

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'father';

export default defineConfig({
  esm: { output: 'es' },
  cjs: { output: 'lib', platform: 'browser' },
});
```

This above code snippet is picked from [zustand-utils/.fatherrc.ts](https://github.com/arvinxx/zustand-utils/blob/master/.fatherrc.ts)

`output` is used to specify the prebundle output directory. `platform` is used to specify the target platform for the build output.
