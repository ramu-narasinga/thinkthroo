title: How to check if a component is a forward ref component in React?
---

In this article, we will review a code snippet from [TipTap source code](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/blob/develop/packages/react/src/ReactRenderer.tsx#L25).

```js
/**
 * Check if a component is a forward ref component.
 * @param Component
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
function isForwardRefComponent(Component: any) {
  return !!(
    typeof Component === 'object'
    && Component.$$typeof?.toString() === 'Symbol(react.forward_ref)'
  )
}
```

This comment explains what this function does — `isForwardRefComponent`

You would write forwardRef in React using this below syntax:

```js
import { forwardRef } from 'react';

const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {
  // ...
});
```

> In React 19, `forwardRef` is no longer necessary. Pass `ref` as a prop instead. `forwardRef` will deprecated in a future release. Learn more [here](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19#ref-as-a-prop).

### Checking for forward\_ref

```js
typeof Component === 'object'
&& Component.$$typeof?.toString() === 'Symbol(react.forward_ref)'
```

I don’t think you would find something like this in the documentation. 

Few things I would like to mention here. If it were up to me, I would console.log the component that is created using forwardRef and then inspect its properties and find a reliable prop that I can check to ensure this component is a forward\_ref. `’Symbol(react.forward_ref)’` this is likely a value of key — `$$typeof` 

I used the docs example to log the MyInput component and it looks as shown below
