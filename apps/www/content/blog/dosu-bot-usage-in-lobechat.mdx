title: Dosu bot usage in Lobechat
---

In this article, we analyze Dosu bot usage in Lobechat pull requests. As I was studying the lobechat code, for some reason I ended up on this [pull request](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/issues/4395) and found that there is a comment from [dosubot](https://github.com/apps/dosubot).

## **Limited Access Beta**

At the time of writing this article, Dosu is in Beta. If you’re interesting in trying out Dosu, join their waiting list at [https://dosu.dev](https://dosu.dev/) or reach out to dosu team at hi@dosu.dev

Dosu can be installed on any repository, but it will not do anything until you’re taken off the waitlist.
