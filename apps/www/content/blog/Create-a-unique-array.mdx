title: Create a unique array using Set() in JavaScript.
toc: true

In this article, we analyze how you can create a unique array using new set in JavaScript, inspired by a code reference from TypeDoc.

Let’s first understand this unique function in the above image with an example and then we will look at how this is used in TypeDoc source code.

# **unique function**

```plaintext
export function unique<T>(arr: Iterable<T> | undefined): T[] {
    return Array.from(new Set(arr));
}
```

This function is picked from [typedoc/src/lib/utils/array.ts](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/blob/master/src/lib/utils/array.ts#L98C8-L100C2).

[Array.from](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from) static method creates a new, shallow-copied `Array` instance from an [iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_iterable_protocol) or [array-like](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed_collections#working_with_array-like_objects) object.

`Array.from()` lets you create `Array`s from:

* [iterable objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols) (objects such as [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) and [`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)); or, if the object is not iterable,
    
* array-like objects (objects with a `length` property and indexed elements).
    

If you were to run this below code in your browser’s console, you will quickly realise that Set removes duplicate values.

```plaintext
new Set([1,2,3,1,2,5,4,3,])
// result: Set(5) {1, 2, 3, 5, 4}
```

Combining these two concepts, you can now create a unique array using new Set(), simple and easy.

# **How TypeDoc uses unique function**

TypeDoc imports unique function into [lib/application.ts at L366](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/blob/master/src/lib/application.ts#L366).

There is a similar approach suggestion in this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35951971).

```plaintext
const unique = (list) => {
  return [...new Set(list)];
}
```

This is picked from Stackoverflow and uses spread operator instead of Array.from method.
