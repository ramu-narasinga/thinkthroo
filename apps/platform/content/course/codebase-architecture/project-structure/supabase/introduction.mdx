[Architecture: Supabase Project Structure]
[L: Introduction]

Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative and gives you a dedicated Postgres 
database to build your web, mobile, and AI applications.

Supabase codebase is quite large. In this guide, you will learn the project structure 
used in [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase).

Inspired by 
[Bulletproof-react's Project Structure](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md)
, We provide an overview of the folder structure.

Supabase is a monorepo and uses [Turborepo build system](https://turbo.build/repo/docs)

In this guide, we study the project structure in this order:
1. [Root level structure](https://github.com/supabase/supabase)
2. [apps structure](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/apps)
3. [docker structure](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/docker)
4. [examples structure](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples)
5. [i18n structure](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/i18n)
6. [packages structure](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/packages)
7. [playwright-tests](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/playwright-tests)
8. [scripts](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/scripts)
9. [supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/supabase)
10. [tests](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/tests)
11. [vale/styles](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/vale/styles)

You will find additional tooling and configuration at the root level, 
these are analyzed and documented in Supabase tooling.
