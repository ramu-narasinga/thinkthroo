title: WeakMap in react-scan vs next-mdx source code.
---

In this article, we will review the below code snippet picked from [react-scan source code](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan/blob/main/packages/scan/src/core/instrumentation.ts#L125).

```plaintext
const cache = new WeakMap<object, string>();

export function fastSerialize(value: unknown, depth = 0): string {
  ...
  if (value === null) return 'null';

  if (cache.has(value)) {
    const cached = cache.get(value);
    if (cached !== undefined) {
      return cached;
    }
  }
```

This is picked from a file, [instrumentation.ts](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan/blob/main/packages/scan/src/core/instrumentation.ts#L125).

This is the second time I am writing about WeakMap. Previously, I wrote an article about [WeakMap in JavaScript](https://medium.com/@ramu.narasinga_61050/lessons-from-opensource-weakmap-in-javascript-d7882bbf01f7) and this was a review about a code snippet from [next-mdx source code](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/d01d6d9c35a8c2725b3d74c1402ab76d4779a6cf/packages/next-mdx/mdx-rs-loader.js#L21) and the code looks like below:

```plaintext
const cache = new WeakMap()

/**
 * A webpack loader for mdx-rs. This is largely based on existing @mdx-js/loader,
 * replaces internal compilation logic to use mdx-rs instead.
 */
function loader(value, bindings, callback) {
  ...
  const compiler = this._compiler || marker

  let map = cache.get(compiler)

  if (!map) {
    map = new Map()
    cache.set(compiler, map)
  }
...
```

What’s one thing that’s common here? cache….

Below is how cache is initialized in react-scan source code:

```plaintext
const cache = new WeakMap<object, string>();
```

Below is how cache is initialized in next-mdx source code

```plaintext
const cache = new WeakMap()
```

Well, there is types in the react-scan source code.

### WeakMap

A `WeakMap` is a collection of key/value pairs whose keys must be objects or [non-registered symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol#shared_symbols_in_the_global_symbol_registry), with values of any arbitrary [JavaScript type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Data_structures), and which does not create strong references to its keys. That is, an object's presence as a key in a `WeakMap` does not prevent the object from being garbage collected. Once an object used as a key has been collected, its corresponding values in any `WeakMap` become candidates for garbage collection as well — as long as they aren't strongly referred to elsewhere. The only primitive type that can be used as a `WeakMap` key is symbol — more specifically, [non-registered symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol#shared_symbols_in_the_global_symbol_registry) — because non-registered symbols are guaranteed to be unique and cannot be re-created.
