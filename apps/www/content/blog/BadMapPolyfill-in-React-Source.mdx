title: BadMapPolyfill in React Source Code.
---

In this article, we study the [packages/react/src/BadMapPolyfill.js](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react/src/BadMapPolyfill.js) file source code.

export let hasBadMapPolyfill: boolean;
  if (__DEV__) {
   hasBadMapPolyfill = false;
   try {
     const frozenObject = Object.freeze({});
     /* eslint-disable no-new */
     new Map([[frozenObject, null]]);
     new Set([frozenObject]);
     /* eslint-enable no-new */
   } catch (e) {
     // TODO: Consider warning about bad polyfills
     hasBadMapPolyfill = true;
 }
}
```

Map’s been available across browsers since July 2015. The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys.

This code above tries to create a new Map and new Set in a try block and if it fails, it is caught in the catch block and `hasBadMapPolyfill` set to true, otherwise `hasBadMapPolyfill` remains false.

# **eslint-enable no-new**

[ESLint docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-new) states that no-new disallows new operators outside of assignments or comparisons. The goal of using new with a constructor is typically to create an object of a particular type and store that object in a variable, such as:

```plaintext
var person = new Person();
```

It’s less common to use new and not store the result, such as:

```plaintext
new Person();
```

This rule is aimed at maintaining consistency and convention by disallowing constructor calls using the new keyword that do not assign the resulting object to a variable.

# **Map and Set pollyfills:**

[Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) in MDN docs provides a link to Map polyfill available in [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js#map)

[Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) in MDN docs provides a link to Map polyfill available in [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js#set)

## **Where is this hasBadMapPollyfill used?**

hasBadMapPollyfill is used in [/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiber.js](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/5d19e1c8d1a6c0b5cd7532d43b707191eaf105b7/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiber.js#L122-L134)

Except the code you see in BadMapPollyfill is written here again. I do not know the reason why.
