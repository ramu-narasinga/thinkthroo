# Think Throo

Learn from open source projects using **Think Throo**.

Modules:
1. Codebase Architecture
2. Best Practices
3. Production Grade Projects
4. Build From Scratch
5. CLI
6. Challenges
7. Leaderboard

> We attribute every OSS project we feature. Our content includes in-depth reviews and challenges inspired by real implementations, not just theory.

## Codebase Architecture
Inspired by the [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react), our architecture analysis is broken down into 10 core areas:
1. Tooling
2. Project structure
3. Components structure
4. API Layer
5. State management
6. Testing
7. Error handling
8. Security
9. Performance
10. Deployment

### How we choose a project?
We carefully select open-source projects based on the following criteria:

1. Codebase Quality
2. Patterns & Techniques
3. Number of stars on Github

### How does this benefit you?
When you establish these standards in your codebase: 
1. You will get consistency across your codebase. Your team can follow these standards and implement features in a certain way that everyone else in the team is familiar with.
2. Easy to maintain
3. Manage technical debt.

This is a common practice in well established OSS projects. For example, Lobechat has an entire docs folder dedicated to explaining the codebase architecture so when you decide to contribute to this project, it is important that you follow those norms in place.
