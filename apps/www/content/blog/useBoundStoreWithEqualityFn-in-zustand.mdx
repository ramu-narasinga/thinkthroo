In this article, we will understand how the useBoundStoreWithEqualityFn function is used in [Zustand’s source code](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/main/src/traditional.ts#L80).

The above code is picked from [https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/main/src/traditional.ts#L80](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/main/src/traditional.ts#L80)

useBoundStoreWithEqualityFn is called in `createWithEqualityFnImpl`function and returns another function named `useStoreWithEqualityFn`.

Let’s look at what’s in `useStoreWithEqualityFn`.

```plaintext
// Pulled from https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/main/src/traditional.ts#L80
export function useStoreWithEqualityFn<TState, StateSlice>(
  api: ReadonlyStoreApi<TState>,
  selector: (state: TState) => StateSlice = identity as any,
  equalityFn?: (a: StateSlice, b: StateSlice) => boolean,
) {
  const slice = useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector(
    api.subscribe,
    api.getState,
    api.getInitialState,
    selector,
    equalityFn,
  )
  useDebugValue(slice)
  return slice
}
```

[`useSyncExternalStore`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore) is a React Hook that lets you subscribe to an external store and useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector is imported as shown below:

```plaintext
import useSyncExternalStoreExports from 'use-sync-external-store/shim/with-selector'
```

slice returned by this function, useStoreWithEqualityFn is further used in createWithEqualityFnImpl .

```plaintext
const useBoundStoreWithEqualityFn: any = (
  selector?: any,
  equalityFn = defaultEqualityFn,
) => useStoreWithEqualityFn(api, selector, equalityFn)

Object.assign(useBoundStoreWithEqualityFn, api)

return useBoundStoreWithEqualityFn
```

Object.assign updates the slice returned by useBoundStoreWithEqualityFn with the “api”.

The screenshot below demonstrates with an example how Object.assign does the update

and finally useBoundStoreWithEqualityFn is returned by createWithEqualityFnImpl.
