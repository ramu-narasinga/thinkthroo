title: asyncDebounce function in Refine codebase, a React framework.
---

In this article, we will review a function named [asyncDebounce in Refine source code](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/main/packages/core/src/definitions/helpers/async-debounce/index.ts). 

```plaintext
import debounce from "lodash/debounce";

type Callbacks<T extends (...args: any) => any> = {
  resolve?: (value: Awaited<ReturnType<T>>) => void;
  reject?: (reason?: any) => void;
};

type DebouncedFunction<T extends (...args: any) => any> = {
  (...args: Parameters<T>): Promise<Awaited<ReturnType<T>>>;
  flush: () => void;
  cancel: () => void;
};

/**
 * Debounces sync and async functions with given wait time. The debounced function returns a promise which can be awaited or catched.
 * Only the last call of the debounced function will resolve or reject.
 * Previous calls will be rejected with the given cancelReason.
 *
 * The original debounce function doesn't work well with async functions,
 * It won't return a promise to resolve/reject and therefore it's not possible to await the result.
 * This will always return a promise to handle and await the result.
 * Previous calls will be rejected immediately after a new call made.
 */
export const asyncDebounce = <T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(
  func: T,
  wait = 1000,
  cancelReason?: string,
): DebouncedFunction<T> => {
  let callbacks: Array<Callbacks<T>> = [];

  const cancelPrevious = () => {
    callbacks.forEach((cb) => cb.reject?.(cancelReason));
    callbacks = [];
  };

  const debouncedFunc = debounce((...args: Parameters<T>) => {
    const { resolve, reject } = callbacks.pop() || {};
    Promise.resolve(func(...args))
      .then(resolve)
      .catch(reject);
  }, wait);

  const runner = (...args: Parameters<T>) => {
  };

  runner.flush = () => debouncedFunc.flush();
  runner.cancel = () => {
    debouncedFunc.cancel();
    cancelPrevious();
  };

  return runner;
};
```

This piece of code is picked from a file named [async-debounce/index.ts](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/main/packages/core/src/definitions/helpers/async-debounce/index.ts)

Let’s try to understand this code in chunks.

```plaintext
import debounce from "lodash/debounce";

type Callbacks<T extends (...args: any) => any> = {
  resolve?: (value: Awaited<ReturnType<T>>) => void;
  reject?: (reason?: any) => void;
};

type DebouncedFunction<T extends (...args: any) => any> = {
  (...args: Parameters<T>): Promise<Awaited<ReturnType<T>>>;
  flush: () => void;
  cancel: () => void;
};
```

So Refine still uses debounce from lodash/debounce, evident from that import. There are two generic types written here, Callbacks and DebouncedFunction.

### Why would you need asyncDebounce?

> *The original debounce function doesn’t work well with async functions,  
> *It won’t return a promise to resolve/reject and therefore it’s not possible to await the result.  
> \* This will always return a promise to handle and await the result.  
> \* Previous calls will be rejected immediately after a new call made.

This is a comment I picked from [async-debounce/index.ts](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/blob/main/packages/core/src/definitions/helpers/async-debounce/index.ts) in Refine codebase.

### asyncDebounce function definition

```plaintext
export const asyncDebounce = <T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(
  func: T,
  wait = 1000,
  cancelReason?: string,
): DebouncedFunction<T> => {
```

This asyncDebounce function accepts three parameters:

* func
    
* wait
    
* cancelReason 
    

```plaintext
let callbacks: Array<Callbacks<T>> = [];

const cancelPrevious = () => {
  callbacks.forEach((cb) => cb.reject?.(cancelReason));
  callbacks = [];
};
```

callbacks is initialized to empty array. cancelPrevious rejects alls the previous requests fired by calling reject with a cancelReason and then set to an empty array.

```plaintext
const debouncedFunc = debounce((...args: Parameters<T>) => {
  const { resolve, reject } = callbacks.pop() || {};
  Promise.resolve(func(...args))
    .then(resolve)
    .catch(reject);
}, wait);
```

callbacks.pop() returns the last item in the array and the Promise.resolve is called on `func(…args)` in debouncedFunc.

```plaintext
const runner = (...args: Parameters<T>) => {
  return new Promise<Awaited<ReturnType<T>>>((resolve, reject) => {
    cancelPrevious();

    callbacks.push({
      resolve,
      reject,
    });

    debouncedFunc(...args);
  });
};
```

This is an important function and returns a Promise. cancelPrevious function rejects all the previous promises. callbacks is pushed with an object and then debouncedFunc is called with args.

```plaintext
runner.flush = () => debouncedFunc.flush();
runner.cancel = () => {
  debouncedFunc.cancel();
  cancelPrevious();
};

return runner;
```

Since runner returns a Promise and asyncDebounce returns runner, this is how asyncDebounce returns a Promise according to the comment mentioned above in this article.
