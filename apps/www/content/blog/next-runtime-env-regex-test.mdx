title: Here's how next-runtime-env applies regex test in Array.prototype.filter()
---

In this article, we analyse a code snippet from [next-runtime-env](https://github.com/expatfile/next-runtime-env/tree/development) that applies regular expression test in [Array.prototype.filter function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter). next-runtime-env populates your environment at runtime rather than build time, it is an open-source project written by [ExpatFile](https://github.com/expatfile).

The below code snippet is picked from [helpers/public-env.ts](https://github.com/expatfile/next-runtime-env/blob/development/src/helpers/get-public-env.ts#L6).

```ts
import { ProcessEnv } from '../typings/process-env';
/**
 * Gets a list of environment variables that start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
 */
export function getPublicEnv() {
 const publicEnv = Object.keys(process.env)
   .filter((key) => /^NEXT_PUBLIC_/i.test(key))
   .reduce(
     (env, key) => ({
       …env,
       [key]: process.env[key],
     }),
     {} as ProcessEnv,
   );
  return publicEnv;
}
```

Let’s analyse what’s happening in this function.

#### Object.keys(process.env)

`Object.keys(process.env)` returns an array of environment key names since process.env is an object. For example, say you have the below in your .env in your Next.js project.

```ts
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=id_123
DATABASE_URL=https://some-database-url
```

When you do `Object.keys(process.env)` based on the above .env file, you will have an array containing the key names.

```ts
[
 "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY",
 "DATABASE_URL"
]
```

#### filter with regex test

In Next.js, if your environment variable name is prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, it is exposed to the public and can be found in the build. In the below code snippet, filter applies regex test to get the env variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

```ts
.filter((key) => /^NEXT_PUBLIC_/i.test(key))
```

This way, you will have an array of env variable names prefixed with NEXT\_PUBLIC\_. Read more about [regular expression test](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test).

#### reduce

`reduce` in the below code snippet is used to generate an JSON object that only contains env variable names prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, in other words, public env variables that are exposed in build.

```ts
.reduce(
 (env, key) => ({
 …env,
 [key]: process.env[key],
 }),
 {} as ProcessEnv,
);
```
