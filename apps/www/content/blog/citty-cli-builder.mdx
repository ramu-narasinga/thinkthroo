In this article, we will review the Citty, an elegant CLI builder. This library is built by [Unjs](https://unjs.io/).

I came across this package in [cli.ts in unbuild](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild/blob/main/src/cli.ts#L2C41-L2C46). Let’s see this in action by running some experiments in codesandbox.

I copied the code below, provided in [citty docs](https://github.com/unjs/citty?tab=readme-ov-file#usage), in a codesandbox project.

```js
import { defineCommand, runMain } from "citty";

const main = defineCommand({
  meta: {
    name: "hello",
    version: "1.0.0",
    description: "My Awesome CLI App",
  },
  args: {
    name: {
      type: "positional",
      description: "Your name",
      required: true,
    },
    friendly: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Use friendly greeting",
    },
  },
  run({ args }) {
    console.log(`${args.friendly ? "Hi" : "Greetings"} ${args.name}!`);
  },
});

runMain(main);
```

and below image shows the outcome.

Pretty straightforward right? let’s now review how this is implemented in [cli.ts in unbuild source code](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild/blob/main/src/cli.ts#L8).

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { defineCommand, runMain } from "citty";
import consola from "consola";
import { resolve } from "pathe";
import { name, version, description } from "../package.json";
import { build } from "./build";

const main = defineCommand({
  meta: {
    name,
    version,
    description,
  },
  args: {
    dir: {
      type: "positional",
      description: "The directory to build",
      required: false,
    },
    config: {
      type: "string",
      description: [
        "The configuration file to use relative to the current working directory.",
        "                 Unbuild tries to read `build.config` from the build `DIR` by default.",
        "",
      ].join("\n"),
    },
    watch: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Watch the src dir and rebuild on change (experimental)",
    },
    stub: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Stub the package for JIT compilation",
    },
    minify: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Minify build",
    },
    sourcemap: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Generate sourcemaps (experimental)",
    },
    parallel: {
      type: "boolean",
      description:
        "Run different types of builds (untyped, mkdist, Rollup, copy) simultaneously.",
    },
  },
  async run({ args }) {
    const rootDir = resolve(process.cwd(), args.dir || ".");
    await build(rootDir, args.stub, {
      sourcemap: args.sourcemap,
      config: args.config ? resolve(args.config) : undefined,
      stub: args.stub,
      watch: args.watch,
      rollup: {
        esbuild: {
          minify: args.minify,
        },
      },
    }).catch((error) => {
      consola.error(`Error building ${rootDir}: ${error}`);
      throw error;
    });
  },
});

runMain(main);
```

In the example provided in the documentation, there were two argument

* friendly
    
* name
    

But the cli.ts has arguments specific to unbuild:

* dir — string
    
* config — string
    
* watch — boolean
    
* stub — boolean
    
* minify — boolean
    
* sourcemap — boolean
    
* parallel — boolean
    

#### run 

```js
async run({ args }) {
    const rootDir = resolve(process.cwd(), args.dir || ".");
    await build(rootDir, args.stub, {
      sourcemap: args.sourcemap,
      config: args.config ? resolve(args.config) : undefined,
      stub: args.stub,
      watch: args.watch,
      rollup: {
        esbuild: {
          minify: args.minify,
        },
      },
    }).catch((error) => {
      consola.error(`Error building ${rootDir}: ${error}`);
      throw error;
    });
  },
```

All the options passed via CLI are used in build function as a parameter. build function is imported from ‘build.ts’ function.
